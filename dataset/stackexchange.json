Babbage's Difference Engine led to the idea of an Analytic Engine, and the game of Tic-Tac-Toe was proposed as a means of demonstrating intelligence.What I'm driving at here is that the idea of analysis and decision making are so fundamental in regard to information technology, that it is difficult to see functions that don't involve them.

        "I want to collect training samples from images.That can mean different things depending on the context. I think of the simplest case, which should be most commonly required. Because it is so common, there may be a standard tool for it.An example would be to have a collection of images of random street scenes and manually collect images of nonoccluded cars from them into separate files.What is a common way or tool to do this:For a large number of images, select one or more rectangles (of arbitrary size and with edges parallel to the image edges) in the image and save them to separate image files.Of course, it can be done with any general image editing program, but in this case, most of the work time would be used for opening new images, closing old images, saving sample images and the most time-consuming part of entering a non-conflicting file name for the individual sample image files.For small numbers of samples per input file, this may need about an order of magnitude more time, and also more complex interaction.I would prefer a tool running on Linux/Ubuntu.If this does not exist, I'd be curious why.",

        "In the context of reinforcement learning, a policy, $\\pi$, is often defined as a function from the space of states, $\\mathcal{S}$, to the space of actions, $\\mathcal{A}$, that is, $\\pi : \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}$. This function is the solution to a problem, which is represented as a Markov decision process (MDP), so we often say that $\\pi$ is a solution to the MDP. In general, we want to find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ for each MDP $\\mathcal{M}$, that is, for each MDP $\\mathcal{M}$, we want to find the policy which would make the agent behave optimality (that is, obtain the highest cumulative future discounted reward, or, in short, the highest return).It is often the case that, in RL algorithms, e.g. Q-learning, people often mention policies like $\\epsilon$-greedy, greedy, soft-max, etc., without ever mentioning that these policies are or not solutions to some MDP. It seems to me that these are two different types of policies: for example, the greedy policy always chooses the action with the highest expected return, no matter which state we are in; similarly, for the $\\epsilon$-greedy policy; on the other hand, a policy which is a solution to an MDP is a map between states and actions.What is then the relation between a policy which is the solution to an MDP and a policy like $\\epsilon$-greedy? Is a policy like $\\epsilon$-greedy a solution to any MDP? How can we formalise a policy like $\\epsilon$-greedy in a similar way that I formalised a policy which is the solution to an MDP?I understand that $\\epsilon$-greedy can be called a policy, because, in fact, in algorithms like Q-learning, they are used to select actions (i.e. they allow the agent to behave), and this is the fundamental definition of a policy.",
        "Is the optimal policy always stochastic (that is, a map from states to a probability distribution over actions) if the environment is also stochastic? Intuitively, if the environment is deterministic (that is, if the agent is in a state $s$ and takes action $a$, then the next state $s'$ is always the same, no matter which time step), then the optimal policy should also be deterministic (that is, it should be a map from states to actions, and not to a probability distribution over actions).",

In short, model-based algorithms use a transition model $p(s' \\mid s, a)$ and the reward function $r(s, a)$, even though they do not necessarily compute (or estimate) them. On the other hand, model-free algorithms do not use such a transition model or reward function, but they directly estimate a value function or policy by interacting with the environment, which allows the agent to infer the dynamics of the environment.Given that model-based RL algorithms do not necessarily estimate or compute the transition model or reward function, in the case these are unknown, how can they be computed or estimated (so that they can be used by the model-based algorithms)? In general, what are examples of algorithms that can be used to estimate the transition model and reward function of the environment (represented as either an MDP, POMDP, etc.)?",

As I understand, this is how TD-Gammon worked.However, when I look at other people's code and examples/tutorials, there seems to be a lot of variance in the way they represent the board state.

The first being 1 for the X player, the second being 1 for the O player, and both being 0 for a blankThen, when branching into games where the specific pieces' abilities come into play, like in chess, how would you represent this?Would it be as simple as using higher input values for more valuable pieces?

Combined with rules of thumbs and inferences such as don't leave gaps. Also Don't cut off one dot from another dot of the same colour.But there are ways to not leave gaps such as keep within one square of another line. That humans seem to be able to grasp but seems harder for an AI to learn.In fact I wonder if the rule of thumb keep close to other lines might even require some kind of internal language.I mean to even understand the rules of the game one would think one would need language.

Also we are able to spot simple regions quickly bounded by objects.I think a built in understanding of regions would be key.

I can't find much!As a simple example, one could express some games in PROLOG and then use neural networks to try to play the game.As a more complicated example, one would perhaps have a set of PROLOG rules which could be combined in various ways, and a neural network to evaluate the usefulness of the rules (by simulation). Or even create new PROLOG rules.  (Neural networks have been used for language generation of a sort, so why not the generation of PROLOG rules, which could then be evaluated for usefulness by another neural network?)As another example, a machine with PROLOG rules might be able to use a neural network to be able to encode these rules into some language that could be in turn decoded by another machine. And so express instructions to another machine.I think, such a combined system that could use PROLOG rules, combine them, generate new ones, and evaluate them, could be highly intelligent. As it would have access to higher-order logic. And have some similarity to thinking.",
        "This at first sounds ridiculous. Of course there is an easy way to write a program to solve a wordsearch. But what I would like to do is write a program that solves a word-search like a human.That is, use or invent different strategies. e.g. search randomly for the starting letter; go line-by-line; Probably the AI will eventually find out that going line by line looking for a given starting letter of a word is a good strategy.Any idea how you would write such a strategy-finding AI?I think the main moves would be things like move right one letter in the grid, store this word in memory, compare this letter with first letter in memory and a few more.",
        "For an AI to represent the world, it would be good if it could translate human sentences into something more precise.We know, for example, that mathematics can be built up from set theory. So representing statement in language of set theory might be useful.For exampleAll grass is greenis something like:$\\forall x \\in grass: isGreen(x)$But then I learned that set theory is built up from something more basic. And that theorem provers use a special form of higher-order logic of types. Then there is propositional logic.Basically what the AI would need would be some way representing statements, some axioms, and ways to manipulate the statements.Thus what would be a good language to use as an internal language for an AI?",
        "Here's a question I might ask an AI to solve:Colour the states of the USA using just 4 colours.Now, a common heuristic a human might use is to start at one state and work their way out. Or start at an edge state. Now this seems to work best rather than just colouring states in a random order like a computer might do. And it means a human is often better than a computer because a computer might just start colouring random states and get into trouble very quickly.(Also I wonder if this is a learned heuristic or would a child develop this on his/her own?)Now the question is, whether this heuristic is an innate optimisation strategy, or just laziness on the part of the human. i.e. colouring things close together takes less effort. Either way it leads to a good strategy.But I wonder if there are any other examples of heuristics that humans inately use without realising it, that lead to good strategies?One heuristic that computers often don't know is If you're trying to play a game don't keep turn around and go the other way for no reason. Again, a human would not do this, but again this could be laziness on the part of a human. It takes more effort to turn around than keep going in one direction to explore it.",

        "The ability to recognize an object with particular identifying features from single or multiple camera shoots with the temporal dimension digitized as frames has been shown.  The proof is that the movie industry does face replacement to reduce liability costs for stars when stunts are needed.  It is now done in a substantial percentage of action movie releases.This brings up the question of how valuable recognizing a stop sign is compared to the value of recognizing an action.  For instance, in the world of autonomous vehicles, should there even be stop signs.  Stop signs are designed for lack of intelligence or lack of attention, which is why any police officer will tell you that almost no one comes to a full stop per law.  What human brains intuitively looks for is the potential of collision.Once what we linguistically perceive as verbs can be handled in deep learning scenarios as proficiently as nouns can be handled, the projection of risk becomes possible.This may be very much the philosophy behind the proprietary technology that allows directors to say, Replace the stunt person's face with the movie's protagonist's face, and have a body of experts execute it using software tools and LINUX clusters.  The star's face is projected into the model of the action realized in the digital record of the stunt person.Projected action is exactly what our brain does when we avoid collisions, and not just with driving.  We do it socially, financially, when we design mechanical mechanisms, and in hundreds of other fields of human endeavor.If we consider the topology of GANs as a loop in balance, which is what it is, we can then see the similarity of GANs to the chemical equilibria between suspensions and solutions.  This gives us a hint into the type of topologies that can project action and therefore detect risk from audiovisual data streams.Once action recognition is mastered, it is a smaller step to use the trained model to project the next set of frames and then detect collision or other risks.  Such would most likely make possible a more reliable and safe automation of a number of AI products and services, breaking through a threshold in ML, and increased safety margins throughout the ever increasing world population density.... which brings us back to ...What topologies support recognition of action sequences?The topology may have convolution, perhaps in conjunction with RNN techniques, encoders, equilibria such as the generative and discriminative models in GANs, and other design elements and concepts.  Perhaps a new element type or concept will need to be invented.  Will we have to first recognize actions in a frame sequence and then project the consequences of various options in frames that are not yet shot?Where would the building blocks go and how would they be connected, initially dismissing concerns about computing power, network realization, and throughput for now?Work may have been done along this area and realized in software, but I have not seen that degree of maturity yet in the literature, so most of it, if there is any, must be proprietary at this time.  It is useful to open the question to the AI community and level the playing field.",
        "Reinforcement?We hear much about reinforcement, which is, in my opinion a poor choice of a term to describe a type of artificial network that continues to acquire or improve its behavioral information in natura (during operations in the field).  Reinforcement in learning theory is a term used to describe repetitious incentivization to increase the durability of learned material.  In machine learning, the term has been twisted to denote the application of feedback in operations, a form of re-entrant back propagation.Corrective SignalingQualitatively, corrective signaling in field operations can supply information to a network to make only two types of functional adjustments.Adjustments to what is considered the optimum, beginning with the optimum found during training prior to deploymentTesting of entirely new areas of the parameter space for hint of new optima that have formed, any of which might currently qualify or soon qualify as the global optimum.(By optima and optimum, we mean minima and global minimum in the surface that describes the disparity between ideal system behavior and current system behavior.  This surface is sometimes termed the error surface, applying an over-simplifying analogy from the mathematical discipline of curve fitting.)The Importance of DoubtThe second of the two above could aptly be termed doubt.Perhaps all neural nets should have one or more parallel doubting networks that can test remote areas of the search space for more promising optima.  In a parallel computing environment, this might be a matter of provisioning and not significantly reduce the throughput of the primary network, yet provide a layer of reliability not found without the doubtful parallel networks.What Shows More Intelligence?Which is more important in actual field use of AI?  The ability to reinforce what is already learned or the ability to create a minority opinion, doubt the status quo, and determine if it is not a more appropriate behavioral alternative than that which was reinforced.A Helpful Pool of Water AnalogyDuring a short period of time, a point on the surface of the water may be the lowest point in a pool.  With adjustments based on gradient (what is so inappropriately called reinforcement) the local well can be tracked so the low point can be maintained without any discrete jumps to other minima in the surface.  However the local well may cease being the global minimum at some point in time, whereby a new search for a global minimum must ensue.It may be that the new global minimum is across several features on the surface of the pool and cannot be found with gradient descent.More interestingly, the appearance of new global minima can be tracked and reasonable projections can be made such that discrete and substantial jumps in parametric state can be accomplished without large jumps in disparity (where the system misbehaves badly for a period).Circling Back to the QuestionWhich is more important, doubt or reinforcement?",
        "Note to the Duplicate PoliceThis question is not a duplicate of the Q&A thread referenced in the close request.  The only text even remotely related in that other thread is the brief mention of climate change in the Q and two sentences in the sole answer: Identify deforestation and the rate at which it's happening using computer vision and help in fighting back based on how critical the rate is. The World Resources Institute had entered into a partnership with Orbital Insight on this.If you look at the four bullet items below, you will find that this question asks a very specific thing about the relationship between climate and emissions.  Neither that question nor that answer overlaps with the content of this question in any meaningful way.  For instance, it is well known that CO2 is NOT causing deforestation.  The additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes faster regrowth.  This is because plants need CO2 to grow.  Hydroponic containers deliberately boost it to improve growth rates.  Plants manufacture their own oxygen from the CO2 via chlorophyll.If you recall from fifth grade biology, that's why they are plants.Now Back to the QuestionSeveral climate models have been proposed and used to model the relationship between human carbon emissions, added to the natural carbon emissions of life forms on earth, and features of climate that could damage the biosphere.Population growth and industrialization have many impacts on the biosphere, including loss of terrain and pollution. Negative oceanic effects, including unpredictable changes in plankton and cyanobacteria are under study.  Carbon emissions from combustion has received attention in recent decades just as sulfur emissions were central to concerns a century or more ago.Predicting weather and climate is certainly difficult because it is complex and chaotic, as typical inaccuracies in forecasts clearly demonstrate, but that is looking forward.  Looking backward, analyses of data already collected have shown a high probability that ocean and surface temperature rises followed increases in industrial and transportation related combustion of fuels.How might AI be used to produce some of the key models humans need to protect the biosphere from severe damage.A more reliable analysis of what has already occurred, since there is some legitimacy to the differing views as to how gross the effect of carbon emissions has been on extinctions of species in the biosphere and on arctic and antarctic meltingA better understanding as to whether the climate of the biosphere behaves as a buffer of climate, always tending to re-balance after a volcanic eruption, meteor stroke, or other event, or whether the runaway scenario described by some climatologist, where there is a point of no return, is realisticA better model to use in trying out scenarios so that solutions can be applied in the order that makes sense from both environmental and economic perspectivesAutomation of climate planning so that the harmful effects of the irresponsibility of one geopolitical entity wishing to industrialize without constraint on other geopolitical entities can be mitigatedCan pattern recognition, feature extraction, the learned functionality of deep networks, or generative techniques be used to accomplish these things?

        "In the book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, by Sutton and Barto, they provided the Q-learning prioritized sweeping algorithm, in which the model saves the next state and the immediate reward, for each state and action, that is, $Model(S_{t},A_{t}) \\leftarrow S_{t+1}, R_{t+1}$.

        "I have a system (like a bank) that people (customers) are entered into the systems by a Poisson process, so the time between the arrival of people (two consecutive customers) will be a random variable. The state of the problem is related to just the system (bank), and the action, made inside the system, can be e.g. offering the customer promotion or not (just based on the state of the system, not the status of customers). To model the problem through RL, 1) it is possible to discretize time horizon into very short time interval (for example 5 minutes as a stage) such that in each time interval, just a single customer enter to our system. On the other hand, 2) it is possible that stages are defined as the time when a customer enters our system. My questions are:Is the second approach an semi-MDP (SMDP)? If I want to solve it with RL, should I use hierarchical RL?In the first approach, if a customer enters in a time interval, it is easy to update the Q values. However, what should we do, if we are in state $S$ and take action $A$, but no customer enters our system, so we do not receive any reward for the pair of $(S, A)$? There would be no difference if we would take action $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, and so on. This can happen for several consecutive time intervals.

Suppose that the planning horizon (state $S_{0}$) starts at 10:00 am, and the first customer enters at 10:02 am, and we sell a product and gain $R_1$ and the state will be $S_1$. The next customer enters at 10:04 am, and buy a product, and gain reward $R_2$ (state $S_{2}$). In this situation, should we wait until 10:02 to update the Q-function for state $S_0$?Is the following formula correct?$$V(S_0)= R_1 \\gamma^2+  \\gamma^2V(S_1)$$In this case, if I discretize the time horizon to 1-minute intervals, the problem will be a regular MDP problem.

        "I am currently studying the textbook Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. Chapter 5.1 Learning Algorithms says the following:  Classification with missing inputs: Classification becomes more challenging if the computer program is not guaranteed that every measurement in its input vector will always be provided. To solve the classification task, the learning algorithm only has to define a single function mapping from a vector input to a categorical output. When some of the inputs may be missing, rather than providing a single classification function, the learning algorithm must learn a set of functions. Each function corresponds to classifying $\\mathbf{x}$ with a different subset of its inputs missing. This kind of situation arises frequently in medical diagnosis, because many kinds of medical tests are expensive or invasive. One way to efficiently define such a large set of functions is to learn a probability distribution over all the relevant variables, then solve the classification task by marginalizing out the missing variables. With $n$ input variables, we can now obtain all $2^n$ different classification functions needed for each possible set of missing inputs, but the computer program needs to learn only a single function describing the joint probability distribution. See Goodfellow et al. (2013b) for an example of a deep probabilistic model applied to such a task in this way. Many of the other tasks described in this section can also be generalized to work with missing inputs; classification with missing inputs is just one example of what machine learning can do. I was wondering if people would please help me better understand this explanation. Why is it that, when some of the inputs are missing, rather than providing a single classification function, the learning algorithm must learn a set of functions? And what is meant by each function corresponds to classifying $\\mathbf{x}$ with a different subset of its inputs missing.?I would greatly appreciate it if people would please take the time to clarify this.",

In chapter 5.1.2 The Performance Measure, P, the authors say the following:The choice of performance measure may seem straightforward and objective, but it is often difficult to choose a performance measure that corresponds well to the desired behavior of the system.In some cases, this is because it is difficult to decide what should be measured. For example, when performing a transcription task, should we measure the accuracy  of the system at transcribing entire sequences, or should we use a more fine-grained performance measure that gives partial credit for getting some elements of the sequence correct? When performing a regression task, should we penalize the  system more if it frequently makes medium-sized mistakes or if it rarely makes very large mistakes? These kinds of design choices depend on the application.In other cases, we know what quantity we would ideally like to measure, but measuring it is impractical. For example, this arises frequently in the context of density estimation. Many of the best probabilistic models represent probability distributions only implicitly. Computing the actual probability value assigned to a  specific point in space in many such models is intractable. In these cases, one must design an alternative criterion that still corresponds to the design objectives, or design a good approximation to the desired criterion.It is this part that interests me:Many of the best probabilistic models represent probability distributions only implicitly.I don't have the experience to understand what this means (what does it mean to represent distributions implicitly?).

        "ContextI'm trying to build a social-consensus simulation involving two intelligent agents. The simulation involves a graph/network of nodes. Nearly all of these nodes (> 90%) will be green agents. The remaining nodes will consist of one red agent, one blue agent, and some number of grey agents. The red agent and blue agent will be the only intelligent agents in the simulation, and their relationship is adversarial.I'm representing the node data structure with the following Node class:class Node():    def __init__(self, id, team):        self.id = id        self.team = team        self.agent = None        self.edges = []        if self.team == green:            self.agent = agents.GreenAgent()        elif self.team == blue:            self.agent = agents.BlueAgent()        elif self.team == red:            self.agent = agents.RedAgent()The graph/network is instantiated to consist only of green agents. When the graph/network is instantiated, edges are added between the nodes based on some probability. So these edges represent the connections between green agents / nodes containing green agents, and they allow for interaction. These edges are undirected, and there are no loops (meaning nodes do not have edges to themselves).I'm representing the graph/network data structure with the following Network class:class Network():    def __init__(self, number_of_green_nodes, probability_of_an_edge):        self.number_of_green_nodes = number_of_green_nodes        self.number_of_nodes_overall = number_of_green_nodes        self.probability_of_an_edge = probability_of_an_edge        self.green_network = [Node(id = i, team = green) for i in range(1, number_of_green_nodes + 1, 1)]        self.total_number_of_grey_nodes_inserted = 0        all_pairs_of_nodes = combinations(self.green_network, 2)        for node1, node2 in all_pairs_of_nodes:            if random.random() < self.probability_of_an_edge:                node1.create_edge(node2)The green agents represent ordinary people. They will have two attributes: voting, which can be true or false, and uncertainty, which is some number that represents how uncertain the individual is about whether they are voting (say, -1 to +1, or 0 to 1). The green agents are not intelligent, and, in each round of the simulation, when it is their turn, they simply generically interact with each other. If it is the green agents' turn to interact, then all green agents with an edge/connection interact with each other, so there is no selectivity. But, with that said, they themselves do not initiate interaction with the red, blue, or grey agents. When the green agents interact with each other, their opinion on whether or not to vote, and their uncertainty, changes based on some calculation.My green agent class is represented partially as follows:class GreenAgent():    def __init__(self):        self.voting = random.random() < 0.5        self.uncertainty = scipy.stats.truncnorm.rvs(0, 1)    def interact_with_green_agent(self, other_agent_opinion, other_agent_uncertainty):        if other_agent_opinion != self.voting:            if other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:                self.voting = not self.voting                self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty/self.uncertainty)*(1 - self.uncertainty)        else:            if other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:                self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty/self.uncertainty)*(self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)The red agent and blue agent are added to the network after the network is initialised with the green agents and their edges. The red agent and blue agent do not have an edge to each other (they do not interact with each other), but they do have an edge to every single green agent/node (so, unlike between the green agents/nodes, it is not based on some probability), so the red agent and blue agent are initially able to interact with all green nodes/agents.The red agent and blue agent are adversaries. The red agent's goal is to convince a majority of the green agents not to vote, and to have these green agents be more certain of not voting than uncertain (based on the green agents' uncertainty attribute). On the other hand, the blue agent's goal is to convince a majority of the green agents to vote, and to have these green agents be more certain of voting than uncertain (again, based on the green agents' uncertainty attribute. The red/blue agents cannot have their opinion changed with regards to voting, so the red agent will always have attribute voting as false, and the blue agent will always have attribute voting as true.When it is the red agent's turn in the simulation, the red agent can, initially, interact with all of the green agents/nodes. And, just like the case of green-green interaction, the red agent will interact with all green agents that it has an edge/connection to – there is no selectivity. When it interacts with the green agents, it can select from 5 levels of propaganda, with each level of propaganda becoming increasingly radical/extreme. The trade-off here is that, the more radical/extreme the propaganda from the red agent, the greater its uncertainty level becomes when disseminating the propaganda, and the more likely they are to permanently alienate green agents (represented by me as the removal of an edge).My red agent class is represented as follows:class RedAgent():    def __init__(self):        self.voting = False        self.uncertainty = None    def messaging(self, potency):        if potency == 1:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)        elif potency == 2:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)        elif potency == 3:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.4, 0.6)        elif potency == 4:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.6, 0.8)        elif potency == 5:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.8, 1.0)And my part of the green agent class that deals with the red agent is as follows:def interact_with_red_agent(self, other_agent_uncertainty, this_green_agent_node, red_agent_node):    if other_agent_uncertainty < 0.2:        if self.voting == False and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                    self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        elif self.voting == True and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.voting = False            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                        self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        if random.random() < other_agent_uncertainty/2:            this_green_agent_node.remove_edge(red_agent_node)    elif 0.2 < other_agent_uncertainty < 0.4:        if self.voting == False and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                    self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        elif self.voting == True and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.voting = False            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                        self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        if random.random() < other_agent_uncertainty/2:            this_green_agent_node.remove_edge(red_agent_node)    elif 0.4 < other_agent_uncertainty < 0.6:        if self.voting == False and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                    self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        elif self.voting == True and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.voting = False            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                        self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        if random.random() < other_agent_uncertainty/2:            this_green_agent_node.remove_edge(red_agent_node)    elif 0.6 < other_agent_uncertainty < 0.8:        if self.voting == False and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                    self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        elif self.voting == True and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.voting = False            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                        self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        if random.random() < other_agent_uncertainty/2:            this_green_agent_node.remove_edge(red_agent_node)    elif 0.8 < other_agent_uncertainty < 1:        if self.voting == False and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                    self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        elif self.voting == True and other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:            self.voting = False            self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty + (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                        self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)        if random.random() < other_agent_uncertainty/2:            this_green_agent_node.remove_edge(red_agent_node)When it is the blue agent's turn in the simulation, the blue agent can interact with all of the green agents/nodes. And, again, the blue agent interacts with all green agents/nodes that it has an edge/connection to – so, again, there's no selectivity. Similar to the red agent, the blue agent can select from 5 levels of potency of messaging. The trade-off, however, is that the blue agent has an energy level, and the more potent the message the blue agent chooses during its turn, the more likely that it loses energy. And, if the blue agent loses all of its energy, then it loses the simulation/game.Furthermore, another option that the blue agent has during its turn is to insert a grey agent into the network. The grey agent, based on some probability, can either be an ally of the blue agent, helping to convince the green agents to vote, or can actually work against the blue agent, working for the red agent in further radicalising the green agents and convincing them not to vote. Depending on whether it is on the side of the blue agent or the red agent, the grey agent's interaction with the green agents can either mimic the red agent’s interaction abilities or the blue agent’s interaction abilities. However, the difference is that the grey agent does not suffer any of the consequences of taking action that the red/blue agent does during interaction: if the grey agent is an ally of the blue agent, then it can do the same move as the blue agent, without the blue agent losing any energy, but if the grey agent ends up working for the red agent, it can do the same move as the red agent, without the red agent having the chance of alienating any green agents. The choice by the blue agent to insert a grey agent into the network, instead of disseminating messaging, will take up the turn of the blue agent, regardless of whether the grey agent proves to work for the blue agent or against it.My blue agent class is as follows:class BlueAgent():    def __init__(self):        self.voting = True        self.uncertainty = None        self.energy_level = 10    def messaging(self, potency):        if potency == 1:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.8, 1.0)            if random.random() > self.uncertainty:                self.energy_level -= 1        elif potency == 2:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.6, 0.8)            if random.random() > self.uncertainty:                self.energy_level -= 1        elif potency == 3:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.4, 0.6)            if random.random() > self.uncertainty:                self.energy_level -= 1        elif potency == 4:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)            if random.random() > self.uncertainty:                self.energy_level -= 1        elif potency == 5:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)            if random.random() > self.uncertainty:                self.energy_level -= 1And my part of the green agent class that deals with the blue agent is as follows:def interact_with_blue_agent(self, other_agent_uncertainty):    if other_agent_uncertainty < self.uncertainty:        if self.voting != True:            self.voting = True        self.uncertainty = self.uncertainty - (1 - other_agent_uncertainty / self.uncertainty) * (                self.uncertainty - other_agent_uncertainty)My grey agent class is as follows:class GreyAgent():    def __init__(self):        self.spy = random.random() < 0.5        self.uncertainty = None    def lifeline(self, potency):        if potency == 1:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.8, 1.0)        elif potency == 2:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.6, 0.8)        elif potency == 3:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.4, 0.6)        elif potency == 4:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)        elif potency == 5:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)    def misinformation(self, potency):        if potency == 1:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)        elif potency == 2:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)        elif potency == 3:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.4, 0.6)        elif potency == 4:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.6, 0.8)        elif potency == 5:            self.uncertainty = random.uniform(0.8, 1.0)The red and blue agents have access to the number of green agents that are voting / not voting, but they do not have access to the green agents' uncertainty levels. Furthermore, the red and blue agents have access to what action the other (red/blue) agent took during their turn. And both agents also have access to the action the grey agent took.QuestionI am now trying to make the red agent and blue agent intelligent. My thought was to use reinforcement learning, whereby each agent learns from previous rounds of the simulation. In particular, I'm currently looking at applying Q-Learning. The problem is that I'm not familiar with reinforcement learning, and I'm trying to learn it by reading tutorials and going through the textbook Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, second edition, by Sutton and Barto.So my idea is to apply Q-Learning to train the red agent and blue agent individually. My understanding is that, in order to do this, I need to define the environment, where the environment consists of the (1) state space, (2) actions, and (3) rewards. The current problem is that, despite studying a ton of tutorials, I still can't figure out what my state space is supposed to be here (for the red agent and blue agent individually), and nor can I figure out what its Python implementation would be. What is the state space here, and what would its Python implementation be?"

        "Starting from my own understanding, and scoped to the purpose of image generation, I'm well aware of the major architectural differences:A GAN's generator samples from a relatively low dimensional random variable and produces an image. Then the discriminator takes that image and predicts whether the image belongs to a target distribution or not. Once trained, it can generate a variety of images just by sampling the initial random variable and forwarding through the generator.A VAE's encoder takes an image from a target distribution and compresses it into a low dimensional latent space. Then the decoder's job is to take that latent space representation and reproduce the original image. Once the network is trained, it can generate latent space representations of various images, and interpolate between these before forwarding through the decoder which produces new images.What I'm more interested is the consequences of said architectural differences. Why would I choose one approach over the other? And why? (for example, if GANs typically produce better quality images, any ideas why that is so? is it true in all cases or just some?)",

I can make a single layer neural network, setting all the weights to 1, bias to 0, and linear activation. And my answer pops out. But how would I train the network to do this from scratch?

An example of such heuristics would be as follows:Closeness of a move to the centre column of the board - weight 3.How many pieces surround a move - weight 2.How low, horizontally, a move is to the bottom of the board - weight 1.etcHowever, I have no idea what the best set of weight values are for each attribute of a move. The weights I listed above are just my estimates, and can obviously be improved. I can think of two ways of improving them:1) Evolution. I can let my engine think while my heuristics try to guess which move will be chosen as best by the engine, and I'll see the success score of my heuristics (something like x% guessed correctly). Then, I'll make a pseudo-random change/mutation to the heuristics (by randomly adjusting one of the weight values by a certain amount), and see how the heuristics do then. If it guesses better, then that will be my new set of heuristics. Note that when my engine thinks, it considers thousands of different positions in its calculations, so there will be enough data to average out how good my heuristics are at prediction.2) Generate thousands of different heuristics with different weight values from the start. Then, let them all try to guess which move my engine will favor when it thinks. The set of heuristics that scores best should be kept.I'm not sure which strategy is better here. Strategy #1 (evolution) seems like it could take a long time to run, since every time I let my engine think it takes about 1 second. This means testing each new pseudo-random mutation will take a second. Meanwhile, Strategy #2 seems faster, but I could be missing out on a great set of heuristics if I myself didn't include them.",
        "I'm making a Connect Four game using the typical minimax + alpha-beta pruning algorithms. I just implemented a Transposition Table, but my tests tell me the TT only helps 17% of the time. By this I mean that 17% of the positions my engine comes across in its calculations can be automatically given a value (due to the position being calculated previously via a different move order).For most games, is this figure expected? To me it seems very low, and I was optimistically hoping for the TT to speed up my engine by around 50%. It should be noted though that on each turn in the game, I reset my TT (since the evaluation previously assigned to each position is inaccurate due to lower depth back then).I know that the effectiveness of TT's are largely dependent on the game they're being used for, but any ballparks of how much they speed up common games (chess, go, etc) would be helpful.EDIT - After running some more tests and adjusting my code, I found that the TT sped up my engine to about 133% (so it took 75% as much time to calculate). This means those 17% nodes were probably fairly high up in the tree, since not having to calculate the evaluation of these 17% sped up things by 33%. This is definitely better, but my question still remains on whether this is roughly expected performance of a typical TT.",

        "I've often heard MCTS grouped together with neural nets and machine learning. From what I gather, MCTS uses a refined intuition (from maching learning) to evaluate positions. This allows it to better guess which moves are worth playing out more.But I've almost never heard of using machine learning for Minimax+alpha-beta engines. Couldn't machine learning be used for the Engine to better guess which move is best, and then look at that move's subtree first? A major optimization of the minimax algorithm is move-ordering, and this seems like a good way to accomplish that."

        "I am interested in the field of artificial intelligence. I began by learning the various machine learning algorithms. The maths behind some were quite hard. For example, back-propagation in convolutional neural networks. Then when getting to the implementation part, I learnt about TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc. If these provide much faster and more robust results,  will there be a necessity to code a neural network (say) from scratch using the knowledge of the maths behind back-prop, activation functions, dimensions of layers, etc., or is the role of a data scientist only to tune the hyper-parameters?Further, as of now the field of AI does not seem to have any way to solve for these hyperparameters, and they are arrived at through trial and error. Which begs the question, can a person with just basic intuition about what the algorithms do be able to make a model just as good as a person who knows the detailed mathematics of these algorithms?",
        "It seems to me that, right now, the key to making a good Machine Learning model is in choosing the right combination of hyper-parameters.Firstly: Am I right in saying, if a model is able to tune it's own hyper-parameters, we have in some sense achieved a general intelligence system? Or a glimpse of an actual artificial intelligence system? I feel the answer lies in what one means by  tune it's own hyper-parameters. If it means to be able to reach Bayesian levels of performance on that task then theoretically, after the tuning, the model is able to perform at par or better than humans and so it seems the answer would be yes.Secondly: I understand that hyper-parameter tuning is done intuitively. But there are a  set of general directions that is discernable looking at results.  Here I am talking about a heuristic approach to perfect a learning model. Consider an example:Say I hardcode a model to, while training, observe gradient values. If the gradient is too large or the cost is highly oscillatory, then restart training with a smaller learning rate.Then obtain metrics on a test set. If it is poor, then again restart training with regularisation or increased regularisation. It can also observe various plot behaviours, etc.The point is maybe not every trick up a researcher's sleeve can be hardcoded. But a decent level of basic tuning can be done. Thirdly: Let us say, we have a reinforcement learning system on top of a supervised learning system. That is an RL network sets some hyper-parameters. The action then is to train with these hyper-parameters. The reward would be the accuracy on the test set. Is it possible that such a system could solve the problem of hyper-parameter tuning? ",

        "I am working on a deep reinforcement learning problem. Throughout the episode, there is a small positive and negative reward for good or bad decisions. In the end, there is a huge reward for the completion of the episode. So, this reward function is quite sparse.This is my understanding of how DQN works. The neural network predicts quality values for each possible action that can be taken from a state $S_1$. Let us assume the predicted quality value for an action $A$ is $Q(S_1, A)$, and this action allows the agent to reach $S_2$.We now need the target quality value $Q_\\text{target}$, so that using $Q(S_1, A)$ and $Q_\\text{target}$ the temporal difference can be calculated, and updates can be made to the parameters of the value network.$Q_\\text{target}$ is composed of two terms. The immediate reward $R$ and the maximum quality value of the resulting state that this chosen action leaves us in, which can be denoted by $Q_\\text{future} = \\text{max}_a Q(S_2, a)$, which is in practice obtained by feeding the new state $S_2$ into the neural network and choosing (from the list of quality values for each action) the maximum quality value. We then multiply the discount factor $\\gamma$ with this $Q_\\text{future}$ and add it to the reward $R$, i.e. $Q_\\text{target} = R + \\gamma \\text{max}_a Q(S_2, a) = R + \\gamma Q_\\text{future}$.Now, let us assume the agent is in the penultimate state, $S_1$, and chooses the action $A$ that leads him to the completion state, $S_2$, and gets a reward $R$.How do we form the target value $Q_\\text{target}$ for $S_1$ now? Do we still include the $Q_\\text{future}$ term? Or is it only the reward in this case? I am not sure if $Q_\\text{future}$ even has meaning after reaching the final state $S_2$. So, I think that, for the final step, the target value must simply be the reward. Is this right?"

To me, this really resembles the heuristic function used by traditional chess engines like stockfish.So, from this I will conclude (correct me if I'm wrong) that AlphaZero evaluates the current position, but uses a very powerful heuristic. Stockfish on the other hand searches through lots of positions from the current one first, and then uses a less powerful heuristic when a certain depth is reached.Is it therefore possible to combine these approaches by first using alpha-beta pruning, and then using AlphaZero as some kind of heuristic when the max depth is reached? To me it seems like this would be better than just evaluating the current position like (I think) AlphaZero does. Will it take too much time to evaluate? Or is it something I have misunderstood? If it's possible, has anyone attempted it? ",
        "I have an idea for a new type of AI for two-player games with alternating turns, like chess, checkers, connect four, and so on.A little background: Traditionally engines for such games have used the minimax algorithm combined with a heuristic function when a certain depth has been reached to find the best moves. In recent days engines using reinforcement learning, etc (like AlphaZero in chess) have increased popularity, and become as strong as or stronger than the traditional minimax engines.My approach is to combine these ideas, to some level. A minimax tree with alpha-beta pruning will be used, but instead of considering every move in a position, these moves will be evaluated with a neural net or some other machine learning method, and the moves which seem least promising will not be considered further. The more interesting moves are expanded like in traditional minimax algorithms, and the same evaluation are again done for these nodes' children.The pros and cons are pretty obvious: By decreasing the breadth (number of moves in a position), the computation time will be reduced, which again can increase the search depth. The downside is that good moves may not be considered, if the machine learning method used to evaluate moves are not good enough.One could of course hope that the position evaluation itself (from the neural net, etc) is good enough to pick the best move, so that no minimax is needed. However, combining the two approaches will hopefully make better results.A big motivation for this approach is that it resembles how humans act when playing games like chess. One tends to use intuition (which will be what the neural net represents in this approach) to find moves which looks interesting. Then one will look more thoroughly at these interesting moves by calculating moves ahead. However, one does not do this for all moves, only those which seem interesting. The idea is that a computer engine can play well by using the same approach, but can of course calculate much faster than a human.To illustrate the performance gain: The size of a minimax tree is about b^d, where b is the average number of moves possible in each position, and d is the search depth. If the neural net can reduce the size of considered moves b to half, the new complexity will be (b/2)^d. If d is 20, that means reducing the computation time by approx. 1 million.My questions are:Does anyone see any obvious flaws about this idea, which I might have missed?Has it been attempted before? I have looked a bit around for information about this, but haven't found anything. Please give me some references if you know any articles about this.Do you think the performance of such a system could compete with those of pure minimax or those using deep reinforcement learning?Exactly how the neural net will be trained, I have not determined yet, but there should be several options possible."

        "I am confused about the definition of the optimal value ($V^*$) and optimal action-value (Q*) in reinforcement learning, so I need some clarification, because some blogs I read on Medium and GitHub are inconsistent with the literature.Originally, I thought the optimal action value, $Q^*$, represents you performing the action that maximizes your current reward, and then acting optimally thereafter.And the optimal value, $V^*$, being the average $Q$ values in that state.  Meaning that if you're in this state, the average goodness is this.For example:If I am in a toy store and I can buy a pencil, yo-yo, or Lego.Q(toy store, pencil) = -10Q(toy store, yo-yo) = 5Q(toy store, Lego) = 50And therefore my $Q^* = 50$But my $V^*$ in this case is:V* = -10 + 5 + 50 / 3 = 15Representing no matter what action I take, the average future projected reward is $15$.And for the advantage of learning, my baseline would be $15$.  So anything less than $0$ is worse than average and anything above $0$ is better than average.However, now I am reading about how $V^*$ actually assumes the optimal action in a given state, meaning $V^*$ would be 50 in the above case.I am wondering which definition is correct.",

        "When extending reinforcement learning to the continuous states, continuous action case, we must use function approximators (linear or non-linear) to approximate the Q-value.  It is well known that non-linear function approximators, such as neural networks, diverge aggressively.  One way to help stabilize training is using reward clipping.  Because the temporal difference Q-update is a bootstrapping method (i.e., uses a previously calculated value to compute the current prediction), a very large previously calculated Q-value can make the current reward relatively minuscule, thus making the current reward not impact the Q-update, eventually leading the agent to diverge.To avoid this, we can try to avoid the large Q-value in the first place by clipping the reward between [1, -1].But I have seen some other people say that instead of clipping the reward itself, we can instead clip the Q-value between an interval.I was wondering which method is better for convergence, and under what assumptions / circumstances.  I was also wondering if there are any theoretical proofs/explanations about reward/Q-value clipping and which one being better. ",
        "I just wanted to confirm that my understanding of the different Markov Decision Processes are correct, because they are the fundamentals of reinforcement learning. Also, I read a few literature sources, and some are not consistent with each other. What makes the most sense to me is listed below.Markov Decision ProcessAll the states of the environment are known, so the agent has all the information required to make the optimal decision in every state.  We can basically assume that the current state has all information about the current state and all the previous states (i.e., the Markov property)Semi Markov Decision ProcessThe agent has enough information to make decisions based on the current state.  However, the actions of the agent may take a long time to complete, and may not be completed in the next time step. Therefore, the feedback and learning portion should wait until the action is completed before being evaluated.  Because the action takes many time steps, mini rewards obtained from those time steps should also be summed up.Example: Boiling waterState 1: water is at 23 °CAction 1: agent sets the stovetop at 200 °CReward (30 seconds after, when water started to boil):+1 for the fact that water boiled in the end, but -0.1 reward for each second it took for the water to start boiling.So, the total reward was -1.9 (-2.9 because the water did not boil for 29 seconds, then +1 for water boiling on 30th second)Partially Observable Markov Decision ProcessThe agent does not have all information regarding the current state, and has only an observation, which is a subset of all the information in a given state.  Therefore, it is impossible for the agent to truly behave optimally because of a lack of information.  One way to solve this is to use belief states, or to use RNNs to try to remember previous states to make better judgements on future actions (i.e., we may need states from the previous 10 time steps to know exactly what's going on currently).ExampleWe are in a room that is pitch black.  At any time instant, we do not know exactly where we are, and if we only take our current state, we would have no idea.  However, if we remember that we took 3 steps forward already, we have a much better idea of where we are.Are my above explanations correct?  And if so, isn't it possible to also have Partially Observable Semi Markov Decision Processes?"

So, it can be easily understood the word batch is generally used to refer to a portion of the dataset rather than the whole dataset.In batch gradient descent, we pass all the $n$ available training samples to the network and then calculates the gradients (only once). We can repeat this process several times.In mini-batch gradient descent, we pass $\\dfrac{n}{k}$ training samples to the network and calculates the gradient. That is, we calculate the gradient once for a batch. We repeat this process with all $k$ batches of samples to complete an epoch.

That is, we calculate the gradient once for iteration. We repeat this process with all $n$ times to complete an epoch.

So, if layers are increasing, then the gradient terms to multiply will increase on the right-hand side.If all the gradient terms on the right-hand side are between 0 and 1 then the gradient will become less and less if layers keep on increasing the layers. This phenomenon is called the vanishing gradient problem. Similarly, if all the gradient terms on the right-hand side are greater than 1. Then the product will become more and more. This phenomenon is called exploding gradient problem.Since it is customary to use the same activation function across all the layers in deep neural networks, all the gradients on the right hand behave in a similar manner, i.e. either most of the gradient terms on the right-hand side fall between 0 and 1 or greater than one, which causes either vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problem.Do my mathematical interpretation of the vanishing and exploding gradient problem true?

In contrast, a purely random walk—that is, moving to a successor chosen uniformly at random from the set of successors—is complete but extremely inefficient. Therefore, it seems reasonable to try to combine hill climbing with a random walk in some way that yields both efficiency and completeness. Simulated annealing is such an algorithm. In metallurgy, annealing is the process used to temper or harden metals and glass by heating them to a high temperature and then gradually cooling them, thus allowing the material to reach a lowenergy crystalline state. To explain simulated annealing, we switch our point of view from hill climbing to gradient descent (i.e., minimizing cost) and imagine the task of getting a  ping-pong ball into the deepest crevice in a bumpy surface. If we just let the ball roll, it will come to rest at a local minimum. If we shake the surface, we can bounce the ball out of the local minimum. The trick is to shake just hard enough to bounce the ball out of local minima but not hard enough to dislodge it from the global minimum. The simulated-annealing solution is to start by shaking hard (i.e., at a high temperature) and then gradually reduce the intensity of the shaking (i.e., lower the temperature)I know its about its example, but I just want more examples where Stimulated Annealing used in daily life "

In this case, when the game ends and there is no $S'$.For example, the agent performed an action based on the state $S$, and, because of that, the agent won or lost and there is no $S'$ to transition to.So, how do you update the Q function with the very last reward in that scenario, given that the state hasn't actually changed? That case $S'$ would equal $S$ even though an action was performed and the agent received a reward (they ultimately won or lost, so quite important update to make!).Do I add extra inputs to the state agent won and game finished, and that's the difference between $S$ and $S'$ for the final Q update?To make clear, this is in reference to a multi-agent/player system.  So, the final action the agent takes could have a cost/reward associated with it, but the subsequent actions other agents then take could further determine a greater gain or loss for this agent and whether it wins or loses. So, the final state and chosen action, in effect, could generate different rewards without the agent taking further actions.",

If I were to do a SARSA update and use the same on-policy as used when selecting an action, e.g. ϵ-greedy, would I basically change to this:if np.random.random() < self.eps:    target = reward + self.y * self.action_model.predict(state_prime)[random.randint(0,9)]else:    target = reward + self.y * np.max(self.action_model.predict(state_prime))So sometimes it will pick a random future reward based on my epsilon greedy policy?",

Summing up, I usually don't see a correlation (or a very poor one) between training, validation and k-fold errors with test errors.

But the problem with this approach is that each model even if trained very well sooner or later will run into some problems like an object that was recognised one frame before is not recognised in current frame or OCR will confuse 5 and S and the resulting string will not be the same so the model can assume there is different car in the same place on one frame.Even though these errors will appear for example at 0.5% frames, this will still confuse the logic of the model a lot, if the logic will assume that the detection/classification results are always correct and disregard potential models' mistakes.Another example can be something that will cover part of the camera view for a quick moment and that will result in misdetection some of the objects on few more frames. So ideally the remedy to that problem should have some sort of memory and validation mechanism that will compare older and newer frames whether change in detected objects was legit or it came back to previous state after some short period of time.Is there any theory or methodology or just some good practices of dealing with such issues or it has to be analysed and mitigated on individual basis?"

        "BackgroundI am working on a robotic arm controlled by a DQN + a python script I wrote.The DQN receives the 5 joint states, the coordinates of a target, the coordinates of the obstacle and outputs the best action to take (in terms of joint rotations).The python script checks if the action suggested by the DQN is safe. If it is, it performs it. Otherwise, it performs the second highest-ranking action from the DQN; and so on. If no action is possible, collision: we fail.During training, this python functionality wasn't present: the arm learned how to behave without anything else to correct his behaviour. With this addition on the already-trained network, the performance raised from 78 to 95%.Now my advisor (bachelor's thesis) asked me to leave the external controller on during training to check whether this improves learning.QuestionHere's what happens during training; at each step:the ANN selects an actionif it is legal, the python script executes it, otherwise it chooses another one.Now... On which action should I perform backprop? The one proposed by the arm or the one which was really executed? (So, which action should I perform backprop on?)I am really confused. On the one hand, the arm did choose an action so my idea was that we should, in fact, learn on THAT action. On the other hand, during the exploration phase ($\\epsilon$ greedy), we backprop on the action which was randomly selected and executed, with no interest on what was the output of the arm. So, it would be rational too, in this case, to perform backprop on the action really executed; so the one chosen by the script.What is the right thing to do here?.

It essentially learns the policy that humantrainers use to rank responses.An initial policy, which is a language model, is fine-tuned usingProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the reward model providingthe reward signal. This process is iterative, with the policy andreward model being updated alternately.The policy is then used to generate responses to prompts. The rewardmodel assesses these responses and provides a reward signal, whichis used to further fine-tune the policy, i.e. the language model.My main question is the first one, the others are just for giving context:1. What's the architecture and size of the neural-network-based reward model?Is it pretrained, too? Is it possibly another pretrained (foundational) language model?By how many samples labelled by human trainers is the reward model trained?By how many prompts and rewarded completions is the language model trained later? (Which prompts, by the way?)These numbers I'd like to compare with the numbers of pretrained ChatGPT:Transformer-based ChatGPT has 175 billion weights.It was pretrained on 500 GB of text data, distributed over an unknown number of documents (from single tweets to the Holy Bible) with roughly 500B tokens over all. During training ChatGPT was exposed to a multiple of 500B samples (assuming that all 500B tokens were used for training).I assume that during RLHF foundational ChatGPT was exposed to a much smaller number of prompts to complete (and to be rewarded)."

In this equation are the $E_{z~p_{z(z)}}$ and $E_{x~p_{data(x)}}$ the means of the distributions of the mini batch samples? Also is the optimal case for the discriminator a maximum value of 0? and the optimal case for the generator a minimum value of $log(small~value)$ {basically a massive negative value}? If so, what happens to the first term during the training of the generator - is it taken as a constant or is the discriminator performing badly considered optimal for the generator? 2.) While putting this in code, for every step is the discriminator trained first for one step, keeping the generator constant, followed by the generator being trained for the same step, with the discriminator kept constant?3.) In every step of training are there multiple latent vectors sampled to produce multiple generator outputs for each step? If so is the loss function an average or sum of all $V(D, G)$ for that step",

The domain and range, at least in most cases, would be multi-variate.

Could this be said about all predictive algorithms? If yes, then could binary classification be compared to having a hyper-plane (as in support vector classification) in a particular kernel-space, and could the idea of classification problems using hyper-planes be extended in general to any deep learning problem learning a mapping?

Not doing so would result in an optimistic game tree, that may work in some cases, but probably is not the best choice for many games, while it would be useful for cooperative games.When the game tree is fully expanded, you can find the best move, even when the order of the expand steps was not optimal, so using a game that can be fully expanded is no good test to validate the in-between steps.Is there a simple to implement game, that can be used for validation, in which you can reliably check for each move, if the AI did find the expected move?",

        "It is my understanding that, in Q-learning, you are trying to mimic the optimal $Q$ function $Q*$, where $Q*$ is a measure of the predicted reward received from taking action $a$ at state $s$ so that the reward is maximised.I understand for this to be properly calculated, you must explore all possible game states, and as that is obviously intractable, a neural network is used to approximate this function.In a normal case, the network is updated based on the MSE of the actual reward received and the networks predicted reward. So a simple network that is meant to chose a direction to move would receive a positive gradient for all state predictions for the entire game and do a normal backprop step from there.However, to me, it makes intuitive sense to have the final layer of the network be a softmax function for some games. This is because in a lot of cases (like Go for example), only one move can be chosen per game state, and as such, only one neuron should be active. It also seems to me that would work well with the gradient update, and the network would learn appropriately.But the big problem here is, this is no longer Q learning.

Is there some special characteristic of a sigmoid that creates a vector of important embeddings?I'd really like to understand the theory behind calculating the cell states and hidden states. Most people just tell me to treat it like a black box, but I think that, in order to have a successful application of LSTMs to a problem, I need to know what's going on under the hood. If anyone has any resources that are good for learning the theory behind why cell state and hidden state calculation extract key features in short and long term memory I'd love to read it.",

        "For a lot of VAE implementations I've seen in code, it's not really obvious to me how it equates to ELBO.$$L(X)=H(Q)-H(Q:P(X,Z))=\\sum_ZQ(Z)logP(Z,X)-\\sum_ZQ(Z)log(Q(Z))$$The above is the definition of ELBO, where $X$ is some input, $Z$ is a latent variable, $H()$ is the entropy. $Q()$ is a distribution being used to approximate distribution $P()$, which in the above case both $P()$ and $Q()$ are discrete distributions, because of the sum.A lot of the times when VAEs are built for reconstructing discrete data types, let's say for example an image, where each pixel can be black or white or $0$ or $1$. The main steps of a VAE that I've seen in code are as follows:$\\text{Encoder}(Y) \\rightarrow Z_u, Z_{\\sigma}$$\\text{Reparameterization Trick}(Z_\\mu, Z_\\sigma) \\rightarrow Z$$\\text{Decoder}(Z) \\rightarrow \\hat{Y}$$L(Y)= \\text{CrossEntropy}(\\hat{Y}, Y) - 0.5*(1+Z_{\\sigma}-Z_{\\mu}^2-exp(Z_\\sigma))$where$Z$ represents the latent embedding of the auto-encoder$Z_\\mu$ and $Z_\\sigma$ represent the mean and standard deviation for sampling for $Z$ from a Gaussian distribution.$Y$ represents the binary image trying to be reconstructed$\\hat{Y}$ represents its reconstruction from the VAE.As we can see from the ELBO, it's the entropy of the latent distribution being learned, $Q()$, which is a Gaussian, and the cross entropy of the latent distribution being learned $Q()$ and the actual distribution $P()$ with $Z$ intersected with $X$.The main points that confuse me arehow $\\text{CrossEntropy}(\\hat{Y}, Y)$ equates to the CE of the distribution for generating latents and its Gaussian approximation, andhow $(0.5*(1+Z_{\\sigma}-Z_{\\mu}^2-exp(Z_\\sigma)))$ equates to the entropyIs it just assumed the CE of $Y$ with $\\hat{Y}$ also leads to the CE of the latent distribution with it's approximation, because they're part of $\\hat{Y}$'s generation? It still seems a bit off because you're getting the cross entropy of $Y$ with it's reconstruction, not the Gaussian distribution for learning latents $Z$.Note: $Z_\\sigma$ is usually not softplused to be strictly positive as required by a Gaussian distribution, so I think that's what $exp(Z_\\sigma)$ is for.",

Is there anything useful about this?It seems like it's more useful to define the return as $$G_t=R_0+ \\dots+R_t,$$ because your return, so to speak, is the profit from investment so it seems like your return will be your accumulated reward from taking actions up to that point.",

After your opponent moves, does each state in the tree have a key to look up in a dictionary?

So, node A's UCT$=1+\\sqrt(2)\\sqrt{\\frac{ln(1)}{1}}$, while the other 2 nodes UCT = 0, because they are unexplored and the game just started, so by UCT the other 2 nodes will never be explored no? Because after this it'll go into the expansion phase and expansion only happens it reaches a leaf node in the graph. So because node A is the only one with a UCT $> 0$ it'll choose a child of node A and it will keep going down that node cause all the siblings of node A have a UCT of 0 so they never get explored."

        "I'm trying to decide which policy improvement algorithm to use in the context of my problem. But let me emerge you into the problemProblemI want to move a set of points in a 3D space. Depending on how the points move, the environment gives a positive or negative reward. Further, the environment does not split up into episodes, so it is a continuing problem. The state space is high-dimensional (a lot of states are possible) and many states can be similar (so state aliasing can appear), also states are continuous. The problem is dense in rewards, so for every transition, there will be a negative or positive reward, depending on the previous state.A state is represented as a vector with dimension N (initially it will be something like ~100, but in the future, I want to work with vectors up to 1000).In the case of action, it is described by a matrix 3xN, where N is the same as in the case of the state. The first dimension comes from the fact, that action is 3D displacement.What I have done so farSince actions are continuous, I have narrowed down my search to policy gradient methods. Further, I researched methods, that work with continuous state spaces. I found a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and the Proximal Policy Gradient (PPO) would fit here.

        "Consider the following problem.We have a process, that generates $N$ stones (e.g. 2000) in one batch $b$. Every pebble has state $s_{i}^b$ and reward $s_i^b$. After choosing one pebble $i$ from the $N$, we start sampling again using the chosen pebble as a starting point and we generate the next batch $b+1$. The state $s_i^b$ is a vector of real-values and the reward $r_i^b$ is a real value.The problem is to choose pebbles so that we maximize reward $r_i^b$ in long term. Because depending on how we choose the pebble, we can sample around the region that gives a better or worse reward $r$.During each new batch, we make one selection of one pebble (so actions can from $i, \\dots, N$. We have access to the previous $m$ batches (e.g. through replay buffer) with their rewards and states.In short, it looks like this:Chose randomly the first pebble from which we start sample;We start sampling from the chosen pebble in the current batch;We sample $N$ pebbles from a process, each pebble have a state $s_i^b$ and reward $r_i^b$;We can chose one pebble from $i \\dots N$ as action $a_i^b$ based on state $s_i^b$ and reward $r_i^b$;Go to point 1 and repeat;For example, at the moment, I choose in a given batch $b$ pebble with max reward $r_i^b$, so$$i = \\underset{i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\, r_i^b$$ and then use $a_i^b$ for a the current batch $b$.But what I want is to choose:$$i = \\underset{i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\, \\underset{b}{E}[R_i^b | s_i, a_i]$$Graphically speaking:Assuming one Batch (N) is 30P - pebble, P - chosen pebblebatch 1: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPbatch 2: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPbatch 3: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPbatch 4: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPbatch 5: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPSo, if I have a batch $N$, when I choose one element from the batch as an action, so the expected reward is the highest in long term, and start the sampling again from it. So only one element per batch can be chosen. And only choice of the one pebble per batch does affect the sequence in the next batch, but not inside the current batch.The problem is, what Reinforcement Learning algorithm to use, when we choose only one item from N. And the one choice affect the whole sampled sequence in the next batch. For example in batch 1 to 4, the reward can be very low, and in batch 5 the reward is super high, if we chose wisely the pebbles in 4 previous batchs."

For example, BERT has 12 attention heads, so the dimension of each head is 768/12=64.While learning transformers, I tried to draw an analogy between CNN filters and multi-headed attention. For instance, increasing the number of filters helps learn different image features, while increasing number of heads help better understand the semantics of a sentence.

        "In poker, a standard deck of 52 cards is used. Each card has one of 13 ranks, ranging from Ace to Deuce, and one of 4 suits: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, or Clubs.The rank of a card is crucial. For instance, holding an Ace and a Jack is significantly different from holding a King and a Jack, or an Ace and a Seven.However, the suit of a card doesn’t hold individual importance. What matters is whether the cards share the same suit or not. For example, holding the King of Clubs and the Jack of Diamonds is equivalent to holding the King of Hearts and the Jack of Spades.Poker players often talk about whether their cards are suited (sharing the same suit) or offsuit (having different suits). They describe the cards on the board as monotone, two-tone, or rainbow, and talk about holding a flush draw or backdoor flush draw. These terms don’t refer to the suit of an individual card, but rather to the pattern of suits among all the cards.So, when encoding cards for a game of poker, it’s important to reflect these aspects. Instead of encoding the suit of each card, we should encode the relationships between the suits of all the cards. This approach captures the essence of how suits function in poker.So, how can we create an encoding scheme that captures these relationships between the suits of cards in poker?",

This normalization allows the model to effectively focus on certain parts of the input sequence. However, I wonder if there are alternative activation functions that could be less constraining and still allow the optimization process to determine the best way to allocate attention, similar to how tanh or other activations work in different layers of a neural network.Is there a mathematical justification for the necessity of softmax in self-attention mechanisms?Could other activation functions, perhaps with fewer constraints, be used effectively in place of softmax, allowing the optimization process more flexibility?Any insights or references to relevant literature would be greatly appreciated."

Because a derivative can only be taken wrt a function.

One must explicitlyestimate the value of each action in order for the values to be useful in suggesting a policy.The above extract is from Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning, Section 5.2 - part of the chapter on Monte Carlo Methods.Could someone please explain in some more detail, as to why it is necessary to determine the value of each action (i.e. state-values alone are not sufficient) for suggesting a policy in a model-free setting?P.S.From what I know, state-values basically refer to the expected return one gets when starting from a state (we know that we'll reach a terminal state, since we're dealing with Monte Carlo methods which, at least in the book, look at only episodic MDPs). That being said, why is it not possible to suggest a policy solely on the basis of state-values; why do we need state-action values? I'm a little confused, it'd really help if someone could clear it up.",
        "One of my friends and I were discussing the differences between Dynamic Programming, Monte-Carlo, and Temporal Difference (TD) Learning as policy evaluation methods - and we agreed on the fact that Dynamic Programming requires the Markov assumption while Monte-Carlo policy evaluation does not.However, he also pointed out that Temporal Difference Learning cannot handle non-Markovian domains, i.e. it depends on the Markov assumption. Why is it so?The way I understand it, the TD learning update is, in essence, the same as the Monte-Carlo update, except for the fact that the return instead of being calculated using the entire trajectory, is bootstrapped from the previous estimate of the value function, i.e. we can update the value as soon as we encounter a $(s,a,r,s')$ tuple, we don't have to wait for the episode (if finite) to terminate.Where is the Markov assumption being used here, i.e the future is independent of the past given the present?",
        "From what I understand, if the rewards are sparse the agent will have to explore more to get rewards and learn the optimal policy, whereas if the rewards are dense in time, the agent is quickly guided towards its learning goal.Are the above thoughts correct, and are there any other pros and cons of the two contrasting settings? On a side-note, I feel that the inability to specify rewards that are dense in time is what makes imitation learning useful.",

The negativeconsequence of such correlation is very high variance in gradients,which means that our training batch contains very similar examples,all of them pushing our network in the same direction. However, thismay be totally the wrong direction in the global sense, as all thoseexamples could be from one single lucky or unlucky episode. With ourDeep Q-Network (DQN), we solved the issue by storing a large amount ofprevious states in the replay buffer and sampling our training batchfrom this buffer. If the buffer is large enough, the random samplefrom it is much better representation of the states distribution atlarge. Unfortunately, this solution won't work for PG methods, at mostof them are on-policy, which means that we have to train on samplesgenerated by our current policy, so, remembering old transitions isnot possible anymore.The above excerpt is from Maxim Lapan in the book Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on page 284.How does being on-policy prevent us from using the replay buffer with the policy gradients?

More specifically, when my agent goes to a state $s$ and opens its available actions $\\{ a_i \\}$, then it estimates each $(s,a)$ pair (regression with DQN) and stores it into the queue. In order for my agent to change to state $s'$, it picks the best pair from the queue instead of following one of the available actions $\\{ a_i \\}$ of $s$. I note that a state has a partially-different action set from the others.However, in this way, how can I model my MDP if my agent does not follow the successive order of states?More specifically, I have a focused crawler that has an input of a few seeds URLs. I want to output as many as possible relevant URLs with the seeds. I model the RL framework as follows.State: the webpage,Actions: the outlink URLs of the state webpage,Reward: from external source I know if the webpage content is relevant.The problem is that, while crawling, if the agent keeps going forward by following the successive state transition, it can fall into crawling traps or local optima. That is the reason why a priority queue is used importantly in crawling. The crawling agent does not follow anymore the successive order of state transitions. Each state-action pair is added to the priority queue with its estimated action value. For each time, it selects the most promising state-action pair among all pairs in the queue.

Supervised Learning can't be used since there aren't any algorithms to solve or approximate the problem (so I can't solve it on the dataset) but for a given decision it's very easy to decide how good it is (define a reward). For example, you can think about the knapsack problem - let's say we have a dataset where each sample $x$ is a list (of let's say size 5) of objects each associated with a weight and a value and we want to decide which objects to choose (of course you can solve the knapsack problem for lists of size 5, but let's imagine that you can't). For each solution the reward is the value of the chosen objects (and if the weight exceeds the allowed weight then the reward is 0 or something). So, we let an agent play with each sample $M$ times, where play just means choosing some subset and training with the given value. For the $i$-th sample the step can be adjusted to be:$$\\theta = \\theta + \\alpha \\nabla_{\\theta}log \\pi_{\\theta}(a|x^i)v$$ for each game with action $a$ and value $v$.instead of the original step:$$\\theta = \\theta + \\alpha \\nabla_{\\theta}log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)v_t$$Essentially, we replace the state with the sample.The issue with this is that REINFORCE assumes that an action also leads to some new state where here it is not the case.

Maybe it has some non-Yolo use?5)I have almost finished an online course in YOLO-V3\\4 and I am quite sure that in this course they do not use nor Pytorch nor Tensorflow nor Keras, but when I read  online tutorials they often do mention at least one of them relating to YOLO.

Do I need to use different commands and different synthax?4.3 If I train on GPU and as a framework use darknet, and tomorrow I decide to move to tensorflow, not including the coding and syntax, are there things that should be installed again in a different way?For instance, maybe darknet needs Microsoft Visual Studio while tensorflow doesn't...",

It may be naive, but it is a bit odd to grasp this idea that, if the goal of RL is to maximize the expected return, then shouldn't the expected return be calculated for some faraway time in the future ($t+n$) instead of current time $t$? It is because we are building our system for the future using current information. ( I am coming from machine learning background and this makes more sense to me).Generally, the expected return is:$$\\mathbb{E}[G_t] = \\mathbb{E}[ R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3}+...

At each step, the agent will pick one location, and check whether it contains the target. If the target is at this location, the agent will get a $+10$ reward and the trial ends; otherwise, the agent will get a hint at where the target is (with some stochastic noise), get a $-0.5$ reward, and it needs to pick another location in the next step.

Since the agent will only receive a positive reward when it finds the target, $\\gamma \\rightarrow 0$ motivates the agent to find the target in the immediate future, which means to solve the task quickly.With $\\gamma \\rightarrow 1$, the agent is trying to maximize the discounted sum of reward in the long term.

End the trial and see whether the result is correct.It believes the target is not at the currently inspected location. It then needs to pick another location to check at the next timestep.If the agent is choose decision #2, the environment will give some hints on where the target is, with some stochastic noise. The noise level depends on the distance between the true target location and currently inspected location. The shorter the distance, the lower the noise. The goal is to let the agent perform the task as fast and accurately as possible, so the agent needs to learn when to stop the trial, and how to select the next inspected location given the hints. The agent also has a internal memory so it won't select previously inspected locations. I would like to compare the agent's speed-accuracy trade off to human's.In a previous simplified version of the task, the environment ends the trial once the agent hit the target location, so the agent only needs to learn how to choose the next location to inspect.

All other classes are not necessary for my analysis, BUT my intuition is telling me that including more classes may improve the model's ability to segment lung tumors.  My rationale is that not lung tumor is very heterogeneous category that can be difficult for a model to classify a pixel into, but giving the model a set of more specific categories for commonly occurring structures may be helpful to model learning.  I am aware that the multiclass approach results in more manual annotations (i.e., time, fatigue, and costs), but that is not the focus of this question.SPECIFIC QUESTION:  Which approach -- the two class or multiclass -- will yield higher accuracy for lung tumor segmentation on CT images?REQUIREMENTS:  I seek a response that sheds deep insight into this problem.  Responses founded on established mathematical principles are acceptable.  Responses founded on empirical evidence from credible literature references are acceptable.  The evidence need not be specific to lung tumors, but it should be directly relevant to segmentation tasks.PRIOR RESEARCH:  I have scoured the literature for a head-to-head comparison of these two approaches, but have not found anything useful for lung tumor segmentation.RELEVANCE TO THE AI COMMUNITY:  While my problem is related to lung tumor segmentation, I believe the problem type is of general interest to the broader AI community.  For example, one may be interested in segmenting peoples' eyes in facial images, and one can ask whether they should have two classes (eyes vs. not eyes) or multiple classes (eyes vs. nose vs lips vs. chin vs....).  Prior knowledge about which method is better would help people plan their annotation approach before embarking on a long and expensive annotation journey.",
        "BACKGROUND: I am trying to think of rational approaches to designing deep learning models for image classification.  One thought is to quantify the complexity of image datasets and use that to inform model design.  By the way, I know that rational model design is much more complex than just quantifying image complexity, but right now, I'm in the brainstorming phase.In the below examples, I qualitatively describe the complexity of the images as a function of the number of channels, complexity of foreground object, complexity of the background, and the number of classes.  Certainly, there can be many other factors, such as image dimensions or bytes/pixel.  I think all images below are 28x28-pixels and 8-bits/pixel.MNIST digits           --> greyscale, simple objects belonging to 10 classes and a white backgroundMNIST digits corrupted --> greyscale, same as above but with added noiseMNIST fashion          --> greyscale, more complex objects belonging to 10 classes and a white backgroundCIFAR-10               --> RGB, even more complex objects belonging to 10 classes and complex backgroundsCIFAR-100              --> RGB, same as above but with 10X more classesBased on the above one has a subjective sense that image datasets can be ordered as shown below based on complexity.  It is reasonable to hypothesize then that the computer vison models should be progressively more complex as well (more neurons, more layers, more parameters, etc.).MNIST digits > MNIST digits corrupted > MNIST fashion > CIFAR-10 > CIFAR-100SPECIFIC QUESTION: Are there any existing quantitative measures of image complexity that capture these aspects of image datasets?PRIOR RESEARCH: Various searches lead me to computational complexity and model complexity, which are not what I'm looking for.",
        "BACKGROUND: To apply multimodal machine learning (ML), the various data modalities typically come from the same example (e.g., chest X-ray (modality 1) and cancer biomarkers (modality 2) come from the same patient (the example)).  The problem is that we often don't have that in public datasets.  Instead, datasets are more commonly independent (e.g., a dataset of chest X-rays from one set of patients and a dataset of cancer biomarkers from a second set of patients).QUESTION:  Is there any validity to artificially creating co-registered datasets from such independent datasets for the ultimate purpose of leveraging multimodal ML (e.g., generate all possible pairs of chest X-rays and cancer biomarkers from different patients with cancer and generate the same for different patients without cancer)?NOTE:  It is understood that this approach is non-canonical and has flaws, but that is not the question here.  I am more interested in learning whether this could be a second best option for researchers who lack co-registered samples but still want to develop multimodal ML models.  Please provide your response along with some justification as to why this would or would not be valid second best option.11/26/2022New NOTE:  I thought it was implied in the question post that I am aware that the interaction between modalities is not available to be leveraged by multimodal ML since this is really the crux of the problem with fusing independent datasets.  However, the question still stands:  Would this be a valid second best option?",
        "BACKGROUND:  Ensemble classifiers are said to reduce bias by taking an average of predictions of several base classifiers that comprise the ensemble.  However, I am uncertain if this necessarily means that they can increase accuracy.  My intuition tells me that the ensemble classifier should perform no better and possibly even worse than the best base classifier in the ensemble.  This seems especially true for bagging approaches which use strong classifiers anyway.  When you have a star performer, it just doesn't seem to make intuitive sense to dilute its performance with subpar performers.Nonetheless, from my novice-level reading, it seems that ensembles can be as good or possibly even better than all of the individual base classifiers, but I'm still not clear why.QUESTION:  How can an ensemble be more accurate than the best base classifier in that ensemble?",
        "BACKGROUND:  When constructing decision trees, the features are selected at various nodes based on whether it optimally splits the samples at that level (i.e., locally) using some user-chosen metric to judge optimalness (e.g., Gini index, Information gain, Entropy).  My understanding is that this is what is called a greedy algorithm, meaning that it optimizes locally but not necessarily globally.  As a consequence, the algorithm does not guarantee that the final tree is going to be the best tree.  Nonetheless, it would be desirable to derive the best tree or, at the very least, know if we have derived the best tree (even if we have no procedure for deriving the best tree).QUESTION:  How to determine if a decision tree is the (globally) optimal tree?",

What are the advantages to using a Tree search algorithm for this particular circumstance and in general what are the different situations where one would prefer to use Deep Q learning and where one would go for a Monte Carlo Tree approach.My current theory is that Deep Q Learning approaches require dense reward environments and games like chess don't really place emphasis on mid game rewards.

The term for the ELBO is:$$E_q[log~ p(z,x)]-E_q[log~q(z)]$$What I am trying to understand is how is this now tractable. The expectations in the ELBO are still over the distribution of q. Take the first term for example:$$E_q[log~ p(z,x)]=\\int_{}^{}q(z)~log~p(z,x)dz$$Is this not still an integral over all z values? How did we make this problem any more tractable by finding the ELBO?Additional Question:Also another thing I was confused about is we always say the posterior p(z|x) is not computable because we don't have p(x), but how exactly do we have the numerator, p(x,z).$$p(z|x)=\\frac{p(x,z)}{p(x)}$$Is this because we assume a prior, and then also assume that we can model p(x|z) with a decoder?",

        "The essential characteristic of machine learning is that an algorithm can discover the behavior of a system on its own. Neural networks are a foremost example of this.But what property do neural networks have, for them to be able to discover a range of patterns?Has the class of all algorithms with that property been studied?I think any function is trainable if it has a parameter of variation, and a rule by which the parameter varies.A trivial example is that the equation y = 3 is “trainable” by this rule:If y < 3, add 1.If y > 3, subtract 1.Starting at y = 0, you would succeed in finding the right value for y.I would like to view the concept of “trainable functions” from the perspective of set theory or category theory, but I am not experienced in them yet.One core premise I am working with is that all of mathematics can be defined in terms of sets, so any mathematical concept - like “+”, or a function - can be thought of as some set. Therefore, any aspect of a system can vary - the operation, rather than an numerical value - and the rule by which it varies can be of any type, not just numerical adjustment, but just random selection of a different element in the set.This is as far as I’ve gotten in my thinking. I think the next point of observation is how some “sets with a rule of variation” are limited. If you vary the m in y = mx, you can not discover a function like y = x^2.The point is to eventually understand why neural networks are so general, compared to other optimization functions.",

        "I have learned a bit recently about prompt strategies. For example, there was a paper about how just by saying “Let’s think step by step” can increase answer quality by like 40%. I have also come to appreciate that models like GPT4 sometimes actually do better with short prompts than long ones. One paper I think found that LLMs have “recency bias”, so if you give sample text, then an instruction, it does better than instruction, then sample text, because in that case, it pays less attention to the instruction.I have struggled a lot with basically zero or few shot prompting GPT-4 to give me highly concrete information and/or a specifically actionable plan or set of steps.To give an example, it very often gives you very vague, general advice like,“If you’re looking for a job, trying looking around on online job websites, or contacting a local employment agency”.If I give it more specific information, and try really quite hard to get it to tell me something way more specific, at best it might add in some very common sites and places, like,“First, think of what jobs you might like, based on your skills. Then, search for those keywords in a job listing site, like Monster.com or Indeed. Also, consider contacting the local municipal job center, [City Job Center’s name, address, phone number.”It has been quite hard for me to try to get GPT-4 to be way, way more like a hardcore data-crawling machine, so to speak. It would be really nice to know if there was a special trick that has been discovered - just like the surprising efficacy of 5 words, like “Let’s think step by step” - where you basically tell it that you only want specifics, and you don’t want just like, the top three - ideally, you want it to figure out every single known job website or app on the internet, every single known job center in your county, every single employment agency and recruitment firm too, all of their names, links to their webpages, etc. Given that some GPT-4 systems are able to search the web, the requested task could make it clear that the model is free to use any information it already possesses internally; search amply and procedurally on the web to find more information that it needs; but furthermore, if it does not know, that is fine, but in that case, it should provide further, actionable steps for the human to take, like a specific place they could ask, or specific google keywords they recommend searching for.Similar to information, I find it difficult to get GPT-4 to make a set of instructions that totally eliminates as much open-endedness or choice as possible - in which every single conceivable way of breaking down a task into tiny actions is present. Instead of saying, “make accounts on glassdoor and LinkedIn.com. Register with your email. Fill out your profile with relevant information”, I want to understand how to get it to say something like, “Ok, your name is ___. What’s your email address? And main skills? Got it. Ok, let’s start with LinkedIn because _____ (intelligent justification, even statistically backed, for why it has a high success rate). Based on this data analysis I found / made, it turns out there’s very high demand for this very specific job title right now, on LinkedIn: ___. And I can easily imitate some common resumes of people in those fields. So, here is the text of your resume: ___. Download and save that as a Word document. Now click this link here: _____, and click “apply” - that job is nearby you and it’s probabilistically likely you may get it. Submit it. Next, check your email once every 3 hours, because ____”.The question here is not so much wanting a true AGI / AutoGPT, but just trying to know powerful simple keywords, prompts, commands, etc., that just help the model understand the difference between specific and vague.

Could one be more used in Shanghai? Or are there some slight connotations different? When is it better to use one or the other?",
        "I've been looking at some very cheap tablet computers made in China and one goes by the English brand name Cube or Alldocube or cube51. Their Chinese brand name is 酷比魔方 (Kù bǐ mófāng).I see that 魔方 is the Chinese name of Rubik's Cube and that 酷 is a colloquial or slang term like cool (as well as other meanings).Even though 酷比 gets lots of Google hits it could just be a regular phrase. I see that 比 has a meaning than, among others.So does the brand name 酷比魔方 just translate to the phrase Cooler than Rubik's Cube, or is 酷比 actually some kind of compound as well.Google Translate translates 酷比 as cool, which is one clue that maybe it's not just a phrase?",
        "When I looked up how to say next some time in the last couple of months I found 下一个.So I was using that and seemed to be mostly understood. But then I started noticing that just 下一 was used by others.I know that 个 is the generic counter/classifier, so is it actually part of the phrase/term for next or could it be just a kind of mistake from using Google Translate?There are different ways to use next in English and I'm sure there must be in Chinese too. In my case I always needed to say things like to the next city / town / petrol station / service area.So what do I need to know about using 下一个 or just 下一?",
        "For lunch today in Taipei I found a small street food place near my hostel.On the menu was this item:  麻油Q米血Here's a photo of the relevant part of the menu:麻油 is sesame oil, 米 is rice, and 血 is blood. But what is Q?I know English/Latin/Roman alphabet letters are sometimes used in colloquial/casual Chinese, often but not always when there is not a character to represent a word or sound from language besides Mandarin, be it English or another Chinese language.What does the Q stand for, and what is this dish?",
        "I'm teaching myself bopomofo/zhuyin keyboard while I'm in Taiwan. My Chinese level is raw beginner too.I just came across the word for tofu:Hanzi: 豆腐Pinyin: dòufuZhuyin: ㄉㄡˋㄈㄨ· (or ㄉㄡˋㄈㄨ˙)We can see that the second syllable is tone 0 a.k.a. tone 5But if I try to enter it using Microsoft Chinese Traditional New Phonetic IME this way the computer beeps and will not accept the final syllable.When I look up just the last syllable on its own, it's actually tone 3:Hanzi 腐Pinyin fǔZhuyin: ㄈㄨˇIf I type the whole word as ㄉㄡˋㄈㄨˇ in the IME then indeed it does work.So what's the explanation for this? Is it due to tone sandhi? Or is it a quirk of the IME? Or is it related to some other property of two syllable words and tone 0/5? Is there a name for this and where can I read more about it?The English Wiktionary and Google Translate both list 豆腐 as having tone 4 + no tone. But I can't be sure whether they are listing pre- or post- tone sandhi rules.But Baidu dictionary and the book Chinese for Everyday Scenarios I've found here in Taiwan lists 豆腐 as having tone 4 + tone 3.",

        "Are there any tools that can convert an entire webpage from characters into either Pinyin or Zhuyin Fuhao?Ideally something like Google Translate.

        "I've realized that I still don't know the way to talk about speaking a language, for instance the Chinese equivalents to sentences like these:Do you speak English?I can speak a little Chinese.Of course there are other senses of to speak as in he speaks very loudly and who were you speaking to? and there is the similar word to talk which cannot be used with the name of a language, except in colloquial or nonstandard speech.So I have found at least two single-syllable Chinese words that both seem to work for the sense of to speak that I am interested in:說 / 说 (shuō)講 / 讲 (jiǎng)Are these two interchangeable synonyms or are there subtle differences? Are these the only two options for expressing to speak XX language?",

        "I'm basing this question on several assumptions, so if they are wrong please say so as an answer:Written Chinese is mainly used for Standard (Mandarin) Chinese.Mostly other Chinese languages and/or dialects are mainly spoken and not written.Cantonese is probably the other language/dialect most written after Mandarin, and dialect words in Taiwan probably next most.Most other Chinese languages and/or dialects have at least a few words which have no established related word in Mandarin. (This means related by etymology, not just the same meaning.)I know in Cantonese there are quite a few characters with the mouth radical, which are used for dialect words and not really used in Mandarin.I know there are a few English letters used in some dialect words. I've seen Q used in Taiwan, C and O for types of coffee in Singapore, and there's a type of cabbage or vegetable often written A菜.If these assumptions are right, here is my question:Where can I find some of the most common terms from any other Chinese (Sinitic) languages and/or dialects which do not have a standard hanzi character?I'd prefer to find links to lists that already exist, but if that's not possible I could convert this to a community wiki to build a list right here.",
        "The topic of 劵 vs 券 came up a couple of months ago and I did some Internet research at the time.I turned up a document about an orthographic reform in China in 1995 which included, among many other tweaks, that these two are now considered variants of the same character in simplified Chinese.More specifically, both characters were already in use with different meanings but 券 was to acquire the meanings of 劵 since 劵 was going to be simplified by merging into 券, thus leaving 劵 as obsolete in simplified writing though they obviously must remain separate in traditional writing and also in simplified writing up to 1995.But now the topic has arisen again and I can't seem to find the discussions that lead me to the official document last time.So I would like to ask the experts here how much of this I have right, if I have anything wrong, and can we find the official document detailing this change?",

        "I learned that the equivalent to bon appetit in Chinese is 慢慢吃 (perhaps also 请慢用). This is a polite thing to do in English.But since it literally means eat slowly, I'm wondering if some Chinese might interpret it literally when coming from a complete stranger. Especially if they are actually eating quickly.Should I think twice before using this phrase with strangers to attempt to be polite?",
        "Very early in the process of learning Chinese as a foreign language we are taught:我是好 is incorrect because 是 is only used before nouns and 好 is not a noun.我很好 is the correct way to say the former很 literally means very but in this type of usage doesn't have this literal meaning.很 isn't always used between a noun and an adjective(This naturally results in some foreign learners thinking of 很 as some kind of special equivalent to to be.)But when should we use 很 and when should we omit it? In some other places in Chinese grammar we use some character with monosyllabic words and omit it with bisyllabic words. I'm not sure if that's the case here though since I'm sure I've seen 很 used with both monosyllabic and bisyllabic words.",
        "In my travels I sometimes get athlete's foot and my medicine for it is now running out while I'm in Guangzhou.I see there are several Chinese terms for this condition.

But there might even be a more specific general term for such medicine or even some brand name?",
        "This morning in Taipei I went to buy a coffee.I knew how to say 我要一杯咖啡 and I knew the word for big is 大.But I didn't know where in the sentence to put the 大. Does it go before 杯 to mean big cup? Or if 杯 is a classifier rather than a noun here, I guess it can't take an adjective. Unless it can actually function as both noun and classifier at once?Or alternatively would it go before 咖啡? That sounds odd when I back-translate literally into English I want one cup of big coffee. But you can never trust literal translations to be idiomatic anyway.",

Even moreseo given that many English speakers are actually imperfect second language speakers and are still active on language learning sites, forums, flashcard sites, etc.So out of English braise, pan fry, and sauté, which is the best fit for 煎?Of course languages don't map 1:1 so the Chinese might be between two or all of the English words, or might overlap two or all of them.",

But this sentence is apparently in the present, based on the context.I checked a grammar book about 了, and it seems that at the end of the sentence, it emphasizes a new situation; something that hadn't previously been, but now is. Is that how it functions here? So is the emphasis on the fact that the speaker is sick now, but wasn't previously, i.e., is suddenly sick?I realize that it could also be that 病了 together means sick, but I didn't find it in the dictionary. It seems that 病 is more illness, sickness, or disease, and is used as a noun, rather than an adjective.So a few questions. How does 了 function in this sentence? Could you say 我很病。, or does 病 somehow idiomatically always have to be accompanied by 了? If 了 has a grammatical function here, could you give more examples of it in the same context?"

        "I've always been a little wary of talking about the future in Chinese using the character 會,  my early teachers made it ambiguous or demanded that I use a 的 at the end of every 會 sentence, but then other times I don't hear them use it. I've gotten a lot of mixed signals. Normally I add on the future time or say 要 instead whenever possible. Even though no one has told me I'm wrong when I use it, I feel like I'm doing something wrong when I use 會 to talk about the future. However, today I went back into my more basic textbook and started making flashcards, but this time I decided all the definitions would come directly from a Chinese dictionary. The English translation for the context of 會 that I was searching for in this case was will. The related definitions were as follows:  (副詞)    １能、能夠。如：「我會游泳」、「只要努力，理想一定會實現。」    ２可能。多用於疑問語氣。如：「他會來嗎？」、「會不會是他回來了？」There was no certainty of the future at all. Does it really just mean 能 or 可能？If I'm not mislead, I think this revealed a reality about Chinese thinking to me. No one actually knows if something will happen. We can only say that it's possible that it will happen. Will is so definite, confident, it's 100% sure. Either that or this is a bad dictionary.So my questions are these:Can 會 directly be used to mean will? (As a 副詞)If 會 does mean will could 我會游泳 potentially mean both I will swim. and I can swim. depending on the context? (Of course, if so, there are ways to convey the meaning less ambiguously, but I want to use this question to find out if I am using the word correctly.)If 會 doesn't mean will how do I say with the confidence of English that something shall occur in the future (using natural sounding conversational Chinese)?"

As he is regularly contacted by Chinese partners, and v.v., he decides to adopt a Chinese name and picks 马丁, which is just a rendering of his first name Martin with common transliteration characters.While 马丁 is, of course, obviously foreign sounding, it is still a valid Chinese name (姓名) since it consists of a valid surname (马) and one other character suggesting a given name part (名).The question is: Is it stylistically appropriate for someone, especially in a high-ranking diplomatic position, to basically use his first name as his (full) Chinese name? Imagine if Martin Schneider/马丁 meets the Chinese ambassador who is 吴XX. The latter will be referred to as 吴大使 (Ambassador Wu), but won't the ambassador have a strange feeling referring to the host country's diplomat as 马丁先生 (lit. Mr. Martin), especially if he (undoubtedly) understands some English (or another European language), and knows that he's using the host diplomat's first name.The general reason I ask is because I see this phenomenon of 'first name as Chinese name' among a lot of China focused journalists, China experts, etc. The more concrete reason is that I need to assess the competence of an actual head of China Dept. in a European country (who is, of course, not named Martin Schneider or 马丁, but follows this 'first name as Chinese name' practice.)I understand that some Western names (first + last name) are hard to render in Chinese because of complex consonant clusters, and a transliteration like 马丁·施耐德 is neither very imaginative nor easy to type, remember, etc. for a Chinese native speaker. But I find it bizarre for someone to just go by his/her first name as a diplomat.Note: I understand that this question can't be answered in an exact way, please suggest edits, or other possible ways to find a solution."

Many of these words are infact standard in putonghua, as in 这儿, and 花儿 and so on, and erhua's usage is seen mainly in Beijing. Southern speakers often have replacements for these, such as a simple 花 for 花儿, and 这里 for 这儿.In northern dialects, this is sometimes taken further, to words such as 事儿, 板儿砖, and even 明儿 sometimes to replace 明天.This leads me to ask specifically how accepted erhua is. As a key element of the Beijing dialect, it's often seen on TV, and although not used as much in formal broadcasts, it is heard in words such as 这儿, as mentioned before. How do most speakers perceive erhua? Is it viewed as just dialectal differences, and non-standard, or is it more to the extent of being slightly more prestigious than other dialects (though obviously not truly standard and formal putonghua)?Are there any native speakers who can try explain their sentiments towards erhua, and the opinions they draw from a speaker who uses it more than average?",

        "I am currently reading a history book by P. Zarrow on the period between 1840 and 1949. When commenting the emergence of vernacular Chinese (pioneered f.e. by 胡適）he makes sparse comments about the views of the opponents of vernacular.In particular, it struck me that the opponents supposedly said, the vernacular was almost as alien to the populace as Classical Chinese （文言文）. And as the reason for this they stated the influence of Western Grammar! Zarrow writes that, while speaking of 瞿秋白，though not explicitly stating that he said it.Now, looking at what 胡適 advocated in a poem of his, it seems not to have been any difficult vernacular -such as 紅樓夢， on which he was a master- but pretty much modern mandarin   都是平常情感。  都是平常言語。  偶然碰著個詩人。  變幻出多少新奇詩句！So, I wonder: What strong western grammatical influence was there in the vernacular of this era?

But 歡, too, carries so many meanings! There is:Happy, merry Sweetheart, love, as in 另覓新歡And some dialect meanings are listed as well.

This is all well acceptable and reasonable.In the Asia, however, especially in areas where influences and interactions with the chinese are part of a shared and overlapping history, how do “official names” in chinese suddenly change?I am particularly referring to “Seoul”, from South Korea. I remember particularly well from airport arrivals/destination boards it was once called 漢城, City of Hans.

Since they are the influential group and were able to purvey this to the group, is it possible that this 'wrong' word becomes the standard in the future?As far as some slang words are concerned, they are usually combinations of existing words, or use words with multiple meanings.

For example, 悉尼 is being used in Hong Kong and in vast areas of the chinese world, except in Taiwan, where the form 雪利 is being used to refer to Sydney.Furthermore, 琉球 is being used to refer to Okinawa instead of 沖繩, which is equivalent to its Japanese name. 琉球 Is the historical name of Okinawa, referring to the Ryukyu kingdom.宿務 Vs 宿霧 for Cebu, Philippines.My question is, why do these confusions exist?

        "In 2009 or 2010, a lecturer at a German university once used the term Sitzcredits in my presence. Probably it was her own invented compound or adopted by a peer, but I like it.Now, what is meant by this? Credits refers to ECTS-Points which can be translated to Chinese by saying 学分.Sitz refers to sitzen in German which means sitting and can be translated to Chinese by saying 坐.What is meant by this in total is that these are credit points which are earned by sitting in a lecture, i.e. by mere presence in contrast to fulfilling a certain academic task like writing a report or giving a talk.By my understanding of the Chinese language, simply putting both expressions/translations of the individual words together will lead to an incomprehensible result. Rather, we have to translate this term by saying: credit points earned by sitting.Hence, I would suggest the translation: 由于在坐上赚的学分Question: How would you, as a native speaker, translate this term?

        "I'm looking for a Chinese translation of this 格言:English: Not ambiguity, but versatility!German: Nicht Vieldeutigkeit, sondern Vielseitigkeit!What is meant with this to give context for a possible Chinese translation:This is an art slogan which is supposed to mean that one painting does not need to be capable of multiple interpretations and messages, but rather that many paintings are susceptible to various interpretations, each single painting at a time, all the time with a new message.This characterizes a changeable, versatile, adaptable artist - a polymath artist - in contrast to an artist who paints the same and always the same painting all over his life, or a whole generation, or a whole art history, who paints always the same painting over the span of thousands of years, as Jean Dubuffet says.Preliminary thoughts on a possible translation:The word ambiguity can be very well rendered into Chinese by saying 歧义 (which means according to Pleco: ambiguity; being capable of various interpretations, and fits the purpose perfectly).For versatility, I've no idea. The Pleco dictionary does not know this word.The German sondern in the German version of the 格言 could be translated as 而.As you see from the English and German version of the 格言, they both preserve a certain repetition and rhyme in their structure (repetition of Viel-, -keit, repetition of -ity). If this can be reflected in the Chinese version as well by the repetition of a character or character scheme, it would be very nice and desirable.",
        "What is the correct Chinese translation ofEnglish: media transfer, media transformationGerman: Medientransfer, MedientransformationExplanation:By medium (plural: media) in this context, I mean the material in which and on which the art piece is executed, what is usually included in the description of it after the title, may it be for example: oil on canvas, acrylic on paper, gouache on cartridge, pencil on sketchbook, etc.In the realm of this question, I go a step further and also allow media which are not necessarily subject of painting/drawing, like: (art) photography, video art, performance, even literature and music, etc.The meaning of media transfer is the transformation of one and the same subject from one medium to another, may it be the execution of your own painting in several different media with variations in the process but definitely and visibly the same subject, the justification of a pencil sketch as a preliminary second medium to fix the volatile ideas before execution in large shapes, but never a sketch which is not a final art piece and is dropped later on and only serves the purpose of planning, the appropriation or copy of a famous or not so famous art piece, again with variations in the process, due to lack of accurate skills or on purpose, like color transformations, the realization of an art piece after a photography template (艺术照片模板), where I suppose that the photography is art in the first place, eg. a conceived arrangement to be turned into a still life, etc.I even go a step further and would also call painting after a real life model, painting your dream afterwards, or even a vision or a hallucination, media transfer, where one media in this case is a certain form of subjective or imagined, but fixed, reality.The notion of media transfer is also closely related to the one of illustration (插图), where the medium of literature is transferred to a picture in a visual medium. For my purpose, I also include musical illustrations, where a piece of music is, in some form, transferred to a picture. It is also related to that of translation (翻译), where different media can be interpreted as different languages.However, media transfer is not the  free, hazardous, coincidental fabulation on a tabula rasa as psychogram without preconceived plan. It can be a psychogram only in as such as by a media transfer, in my sense, this effect can be achieved as well by modifications in the execution from one medium to another.You might argue that in the later case the artist transfers his instant imagination to a picture. But, I'm not willing to allow this under the term of media transfer. After all, I differentiate between reality, imagined reality and imagination.Media transfer is also not a notion of a doctrine of abstraction which tries to eradicate the subject matter. It can make the subject unrecognizable, however, due to some sort of zooming in or zooming out, due to blurring, etc."

        "I thouht 还 ment besides or además(in spanish)， it gives more informatión but let me give you an example There are clear examples like when you say i play piano, he plays piano to. Here where you have two subjects doing the same thing is obvius that you use 也。But in the next example I asked my teacher if you could use 还 instead of 也 and she said that if you use 还 it is not right or properly used. ¿is it because you are still talking about things about his studies in both sentences?. She said 还 would not be proper but would not explain clear to me.他上课时开始不专心听讲。他的学习成绩也越来越差。Saludos desde España. Málaga. Greetings from Málaga Spain.",
        "I have three point to be clear about describing people.1) In describing a person structures like this are usual.我有一个好朋友叫徐浙峰，他的个子高高的，头发短短的，眼睛像葡萄一样亮.What i understand is that in the sentences 他的个子高高的 the verb 是 is omitted after 个子 in a 是的 construction or no?  Could you say 他的个子高， without 的。 If so what is the diference?In the second sentence 头发短短的   他 is omitted at the begining. ¿is it because it is the second sentece and we asume tha we are talking about the same person.2) 他的个子高高的  which we saw in the first point is also seen as ，高高的鼻子 when describing as a second clause. What is the diference between 高高的鼻子  and 鼻子高高的。 Is it because the clause becaus must have a 有 when using 高高的鼻子 and a 是 maybe omitted in the first clause. For example in the next sentece the 有 could be omitted in many of the clauses.她有一头卷卷的黄头发，有一双乌黑的葡萄般的大眼睛，有一个高高的鼻子，还有一张樱桃小嘴。”3) Another point for me to be clear is that i found this article in chinese. From what I understand is better not to use 有 when describing people or even may not be right. 写外貌不用“有”作文如何写外貌？孩子的作文里总会看到类似这样的句子：“XX可漂亮了，她有一头卷卷的黄头发，有一双乌黑的葡萄般的大眼睛，有一个高高的鼻子，还有一张樱桃小嘴。”如果你试着去掉文中的“有”，把文字重新串联一遍，会发现作文顺了很多。例如：“XX可漂亮啦。一头卷卷的黄头发自然地披在肩上。她的眼睛太吸引人了，乌黑乌黑葡萄一般。高高的鼻子，和樱桃小嘴配合起来，有点混血的味道，同学们可喜欢她啦。”是不是读起来舒服多了？",

        "Hello i have a doubt about where  在 has to be?I have two references listed below about our matter. The first one talks about movement or location and the second about movement with displacement for the 在 to be after the verb. That second one I think is better.For example verbs like  睡觉，站，坐，can have 在 after the verb. No movement is involved. like 弟弟不肯睡在房车里。 what about the 觉。 why is it missing in this sentence? What about verbs like 想，考虑。where would you put the  在。 For example.  I was under the tree thinking about the future.  I am not moving can I say  我在想在树下面。 would be right or not?  And I have another doubt. It says in the firs reference from wiki我 学习 在 图书馆。Wǒ xuéxí zài túshūguǎn. is incorrect. but 学习 does not imply movement so I am a bit confused.Could you solve my doubts and make it clear for me? thanks.from wiki.This pattern is used regularly with special types of verbs, including: 住 (zhù), 放 (fàng), 坐 (zuò), and 站(zhàn). These are verbs that imply movement or location. Technically, the structure is called a locationcomplement, but it can be understood without going into that much detail. Just remember that for verbsimplying movement or location like the ones above, the default sentence order changes and you get thisstructure:Subj. + [Special Verb] + 在 + LocationExamples你 住 在 上海吗?Nǐ zhù zài Shànghǎi ma? Do you live in Shanghai?他 坐 在 老板 的 旁边。Tā zuò zài lǎobǎn de pángbiān.He sits next to the boss.你 应该 站 在 我 后面。Nǐ yīnggāi zhàn zài wǒ hòumiàn.You should stand behind me.不要 坐 在我 的 床 上。Bùyào zuò zài wǒ de chuáng shàng.Don't sit on my bed.你 的 衣服 不 可以 放 在 这里。Nǐ de yīfu bù kěyǐ fàng zài zhèlǐ.You can't put your clotheshere.不要 站 在 路 中间。Bùyào zhàn zài lù zhōngjiān.Don't stand in the middle of the road.不要 坐 在 地 上。Bùyào zuò zài dì shàng.Don't sit on the ground.那 本 书 我 放 在 桌子 上 了。Nà běn shū wǒ fàng zài zhuōzi shàng le.I placed that book onthe table.不要 走 在 草地 上。Búyào zǒu zài cǎodì shàng.Don't walk on the grass.周末 我 不 想 待 在 家 里。Zhōumò wǒ bù xiǎng dāi zài jiā lǐ.I don't want to stay at home onweekends.Remember that this is an exception to the normal rule. A common mistake is to over apply this and produceincorrect sentences. Note the incorrect and correct versions below.我 工作 在 上海。Wǒ gōngzuò zài Shànghǎi.我 在 上海工作。Wǒ zài Shànghǎi gōngzuò.I work in Shanghai.我 学习 在 图书馆。Wǒ xuéxí zài túshūguǎn.我 在 图书馆 学习。Wǒ zài túshūguǎnfrom a book6.2 Dynamic and static differences A noticeable semantic dimension thataffects the use of action verbs in Chinese is the difference betweendynamic and static verbs. A dynamic action verb implies that the actiontravels across a certain space, whereas a static action verb does not. Thiscan be clearly illustrated by the difference between ‘walk’ and ‘stand’:when one walks, one moves from one location to another, whereas whenone stands, one either stays in one place or changes from a sitting positionto a standing position and no change of location is involved.The dynamic or static nature of an action verb will decide whether alocation phrase associated with it precedes or follows it. A dynamic actionverb will have location phrases preceding it, whereas a static action verbmay have a location phrase either preceding it or following it. Forexample:他 在 公 园 里 散 步。 tā zài gōngyuán li sànbù He is having a walk in thepark.*他 散 步 在 公 园 里。 *tā sànbù zài gōngyuán li He is having a walk inthe park.他 在 草 地 上 坐 着。 Nota 4. tā zài càodì shàng zuò zhe He is sitting onthe grass.他 坐 在 草 地 上。 tā zuò zài càodì shàng He is sitting on the grass.Nota 4 The addition of the particle 着 zhe to the verb changes it fromnarrative mode to descriptive mode. This will be discussed in",

        "桌上摆有一卷书(source: example sentence in a publicly available flashcard deck - no other context provided).None of the 40+ dictionaries I consulted carry this lemma, and google offers precious little too.I would have used 摆着 (or 放着) in that context; is 有 a typo for 着 or is 摆有 (and perhaps 放有) a legitimate word? If so, is it dialectal? Can you think of any other such -有 constructions, aside from normal dictionary words like 拥有, 持有, etc. ?Thank you.",
        "Observation:保有财产; 抱有好感; 怀有敌意; 他俩育有一子; 学校设有音乐课; 杯子留有指纹Bi-syllabic verbal compounds like those in bold above are sometimes treated as words (insofar as I found them all listed as entries/lemmas in at least one dictionary). When they do, they are presented as forming a lexical unit.However,桌上摆有一卷书; 屋中堆有一百袋大米; 庭中种有几棵树; 车上坐有四人; 桌上放有信件; 床下藏有黄金; 林里搭有帐篷; 城内通有地铁; 东北流有福溪Bi-syllabic verbal compounds like these are not recorded in any dictionary, although they are similarly-formed and otherwise unexceptional. When pressed, people simply describe them as serial verb constructions.Problem:Chinese grammars describe many types of serial verb constructions, but NEVER in the V+有 pattern. Chinese dictionaries rarely if ever list any of the above V+有 compounds as words, as observed above. So how are we to analyse these compounds?Morphologically, they do seem perfectly good candidates for word-hood but, syntactically, they could also be described as resultative constructions of one form or another.Questions:Do you think they are all simply collocations of verbs arranged in a resultative (or other?) construction?If not (and so you think some of them are words), are there any criteria we can use to explain why some are to be excluded from word-hood?If you're a Chinese native speaker, do compounds like 摆有, 堆有, 种有, 坐有 (which never appear in dictionaries) strike you as creative constructions?If so: Would you compose them each time afresh, based on context? (For example, thinking of 庭+有树 and deciding to add in 种 to clarify how the tree are in the courtyard or thinking about 车+有人 and deciding to add in 坐 to clarify how the people are in the car)?If not: Does it surprise you that some dictionaries list compounds like 持有, 保有, 抱有 and 育有 but no dictionary lists compounds like 摆有, 坐有, 种有 and 堆有? How would you explain this fact?",
        "I've encountered the sentence 把准备好的葱姜蒜全扣里, in the context of having to tip some ingredients into a previously-mentioned pan.I wonder if 里 is acting as an internal object of 扣 or as its locative complement.里(面) is often used as a nominal postposition, syntactically equivalent to the inside of in English. In such cases, it has been successfully analysed as a noun - a non-prototypical noun, but a noun nonetheless. This would lead me to believe that 扣里 = V+Obj.But I do wonder whether 里 can ever be conceived to behave as a verbal complement, one capable of standing in for 进 or 入, for example. Is there any sense in which this could be the case? Is there any dialect, particularly in northern/Beijing area, where 扣里 can normally stand in for 扣进?",
        "Phonetic transliterations of foreign words are not uncommon in Mandarin, e.g. 沙发 for sofa, 逻辑 for logic, etc.Much less common are what I would call transliterated characters or phono-semantic transliterations, where a loanword is assigned a unique character matching it both in pronunciation and graphic form (the latter usually by means of an appropriate semantic component). In antiquity, characters for foreign plants and animals (e.g. 狮) may have been coined using this type of phonosemantic transliteration, as suggested in the comments.Nowadays, transliterated characters are only said to occur in the context of naming chemical elements, which are assigned unique phonosemantic characters (形声字) made up of a phonetic component matching their English/Latin name and a semantic component matching their physical typology (gaseous, metallic, etc).However, I only just noticed that the word for pump, pronounced beng4 and written with the logographic character 泵 (a 会意字), also fits the description of a transliterated character - despite being neither a chemical element nor a 形声字.I wonder if I have just found the only transliterated character outside of chemistry, if not perhaps the only transliterated loanword in all of Chinese that is written with its own 会意字 logogram. So my questions are:Outside of chemistry, is there any other character that, just like 泵, is used to transliterate a foreign word both phonetically and semantically?Even including all neo-characters from chemistry and beyond, is there any other transliterated loanword written with its own 会意字?",
        "Is there any attested etymology for this word or can anyone otherwise attempt to break down its compositional logic for me please?On the face of it, 是指 looks structurally similar to 是说. However, the 是 in 是指 lacks any emphatic or contrastive or concessive sense; in fact, 是指 is frequently used in the most declarative of contexts, such as dictionary definitions and the like.My intuition tells me this word must have resulted from the lexicalisation of a longer construction:  something like X+是+指(=针对)Y+的意思 turning into X+是指+Y.I would be grateful for any other suggestion."

I first read 各 as referring to each lens but for that to be the case, I think the lens would have to be the subject in that clause but I can’t seem to find a matching predicate as 在 seems to be used as a preposition here and 綹 seems to be used only as a noun and even if it was used as a verb, it would be unlikely to express something a lens does on the temples of glasses. So I think 各 should be read as referring to each temple, but I’m not sure if it’s permitted to put 各 before 在 instead of immediately before 鏡腿. And even if I assume that’s OK, I still can’t make out what the clause is supposed to mean because there seems to be no verb in it.

There was also activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is associated with monetary valuation of a stimulus, during disposal of items that they had acquired during the experiment.Firstly, is the treatment of people like property an earmark of any notable (Axis II or otherwise) DSM disorder?Secondly, in the case where we assume those that do treat others as property to be acquired and disposed of accordingly, do these same anatomical regions in the OFC govern this behavior?Wang, J.M., Seidler, R.D., et al (2012),The neural bases of acquisitiveness: Decisions to acquire and discard everyday goods differ across frames, items, and individuals.

Predictive coding can be modeled using a Bayesian framework, with predictions being made about the what aspect conditioned on the reactions to prior stimuli.In certain circumstances --- intense military march to a drum beat or, for the young, dancing to a bass-heavy song in a nightclub --- it seems to be possible to dampen the what aspect completely since the Bayesian priors on what are near-certainty.

        "Certainly, you have reading comprehension passages on the SAT, GRE, and LSAT. But beyond that point, is it really possible to measure reading comprehension through multiple-choice tests? There are multiple motivations for why an author may make argument X, and multiple interpretations of his exact argument, which may be affected by the immediate circumstances that made him write that argument at that particular point in time (and while we may know a bit about the society that he lived in, chances are that we'll probably never know who he intended the book to be written for - hell - some people probably intended to write a book to impress some potential lover [and hell, maybe some passages in the book are motivated to attract the sympathy of that lover] even though they pretended to write it for the greater good of society). I mean, all you have to do is to look at courtrooms. There, people pretty much argue about what people (in a case with precedent) actually meant, and there's usually no concrete (and correct) answer. And people who study the life of a particular philosopher may have multiple interpretations of why philosopher X wrote passage Y, and what X really meant in writing passage Y. Plus, it's oftentimes very interesting to read the writing of someone you know REALLY well because you know their life so well that you can dream up hypotheses of what prompted them to write passage X at time Y (and you also know his social network so you could imagine what audience he had in mind, and what audience he might have secretly hoped to impress without mentioning it). And perhaps because of this, reading comprehension is not a skill with a single scale, since people are better at understanding some people than they are at understanding others.I mean, I guess the ultimate test of reading comprehension would be to test someone on one of Immanuel Kant's books, or on some recent postmodernist book (made artificially difficult to read/parse), and then ask him well, what is Kant trying to get at? But is that really a valid test? Or maybe one where you have to dissect the entire structure of a book where X is pretending to be Y pretending to be Y pretending to be X (of course, such books are rarely written, but theoretically possible). Alternatively, wouldn't someone with exceptional reading comprehension be better at reading crappy writing?

She found that after five weeks of  computerized training on tasks ranging from reproducing a series of  light flashes to repeating digits in the opposite order that they were  given, the older group was able to reach the same level of working  memory, attention and reaction time that the younger group had at the  outset. (Notably, the younger group had even greater improvements by  the end of the training period.)

        "ContextI sometimes speak to researchers studying the relationship between variables in clinical psychology samples.A typical example is as follows:100 patients with diagnosed depressionmany clinically relevant variables are measured such as demographics, anxiety, intelligence, drug and alcohol use, and so on.Researchers often want to then develop models of what predicts depression.However, the problem is that the sample was selected because they already have been deemed to possess a certain threshold level of depression.Substantial variation still remains in depression with some participants being more severe than others.Thus, there are problems in trying to generalise observed relationships to describe what predicts depression, because it is not a random sample of the population.I use depression as a specific case, but the problem applies to many studies of clinical populations (e.g., kids with behavioural problems, kids with intellectual disabilities, OCD, etc.).QuestionWhat advice would you give to such researchers about how to analyse and generalise from such data?Are there any references that provide an example of best practice of how to analyse and generalise from such data?",

        "Imagine an experiment like this:A participant is asked to optimize an unknown function (let's say minimize) .On each trial the participant provides several input values, and receives an output value.Now also imagine that the output is noisy, in that the same inputs lead to an output plus a  random component. To think of but one of many possible specific examples imagine the following function$$Y = (X -3)^2 + (Z-2)^2 + (W-4)^2 + e,$$where $e$ is normally distributed, mean = 0, sd = 3. On each trial, the participant would provide a value for $X$, $Z$, and $W$.And they would obtain a $Y$ value based on this underlying function. Their aim would be to minimise the value of $Y$.They have not been told the underlying functional form.They only know that there is a global minimum and that there is a random component.I'm interested in reading about the strategies used by humans to do this task in experimental settings.

        "Context:I was at a talk today where data was  presented  where a group of sports people ranked their own performance and everyone else in the group. This enabled self-rated performance to be correlated with the average of other-rated performance. The general observation was that there was a strong relationship between the two variables, but that where self-rated performance deviated from other-rated performance, people tended to rate themselves higher.This raises the question of what this self-other discrepancy represents.One answer is that people have a self-serving bias. Another answer is that people have unique information about themselves.Question:Thus, I'm interested in studies that have looked at what self-rated performance predicts over and above other-rated performance. In particular:To what extent does self-rated performance predict objective performance over and above other-rated performance?I imagine these findings would vary as a function of a range of factors including type of task, number of rated used form the other-rating, and so on.

        "I have often read that ability tests are indicative of what people can do, but that job performance also depends on what people will do.For example, Ackerman and Beier (2012) wrote that:  There is a fundamental mismatch between what is measured by extant  intelligence tests and the criteria one is most interested in, when  predicting job-related performance measures, that is, the mismatch  between typical and maximal behaviors. ... Although assessments of  what someone can do will serve as an assessment of the upper bound of  a person’s performance on the day that the applicant is assessed, I–O  psychologists and managers are most interested in what the applicant  will do on a day-to-day basis on the job—that is, the individual’s  typical performance.Thus, my questions are:What is the  correlation between maximal job performance and typical job performance?To what extent do ability tests predict maximal performance more than typical performance?I'm interested in learning about empirical studies that have tested these ideas. I also imagine that findings will vary based on factors related to the work setting, and so forth (e.g., some work environments permit greater variability in discretionary effort). Also, presumably the degree to which ability-performance correlations differ between typical and maximal will be greater where the correlation between typical and maximal is lower. I'm also interested in understanding more about the methodological challenges associated with operationalising typical and maximal performance.ReferencesAckerman, P. L., Beier, M.

        "Assume a teacher constructs a four-choice multiple choice test. Each item has only one correct response. The test is scored from 0 to 100 representing the percentage of items answered correctly. I want to have some rules of thumb that could be informative regarding how many items are required to achieve a given standard error of measurement. For example, it would be nice to be able to advice teachers who write their own multiple choice exams if you have 100 items that are reasonably well worded, you can expect a standard error of measurement of 2.5. The standard error of measurement is often defined as:$$s_e=s_x \\sqrt{1-r_{xx}}$$where $s_x$ is the standard deviation and $r_{xx}$ is the reliability.Furthermore internal consistency reliability can be calculated from the number of items $k$ and the mean inter-item correlation $\\bar{r}_{ij}$ (i.e., average correlation between item $i$ and item $j$ for all $k$ items where $i\\neq j$):$$r_{xx}=\\frac{k(\\bar{r}_{ij})}{1 + (k -1) \\bar{r}_{ij}}$$However, I'm wanting to translate the above information into meaningful recommendations for teachers. Thus, this assumes that I have some empirical estimate of typical values of $\\bar{r}_{ij}$ and that I have an estimate of $s_x$. It then requires application of the formulas to calculate standard errors of measurement for likely numbers of items $k$. In particular, I was thinking about numbers of items equal to: 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 120, 150, and 200.Thus, I was wondering whether there are any published estimates of the standard error of measurement teacher constructed multiple choice tests.",
        "When planning a psychological study, researchers are often asked to formulate an estimate of  expected effect sizes for important hypotheses in the study. This might be the expected group mean difference (e.g., Cohen's d), the correlation between two variables, the odds ratio, or any number of other effects of interest.Such estimates can then link into power analysis and sample size calculations.However, often formulating such an estimate is a difficult task. The exact study has not been performed before. Meta-analyses may only be partially related to the hypothesis of interest.

        "There are quite a few meta-analyses of the relationship between personality and job performance (for a review, see Barrick & Mount, 2012; and specific meta-analyses: Barrick & Mount, 1991; Murray R Barrick, Michael K Mount, & Timothy A Judge, 2001; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; J. Salgado, 1997; Tett, Jackson, & Rothstein, 1991). These often come up with raw meta-analytic mean correlations between conscientiousness and job performance of around r = .15.However, there is a lot of discussion in general at the moment about replicability  and publication bias. In particular, if papers that showed a correlation between personality and job performance, were more likely to be published, then this would inflate the meta-analytic estimate. Alternatively, there have been quite a few studies of personality and performance with huge sample sizes (10,000+) and these would quite likely be published regardless of the exact results, and they also would have sufficient statistical power to detect even small effects. And for most meta-analyses, large sample size studies get a greater weighting in the estimation process.I seem to remember reading a paper a few months back that examined this question. If I recall, the authors concluded that the meta-analytic estimate of relationship between conscientiousness and performance might be inflated slightly.

I.e., about three quarters of the items are reverse scored.For example, items measuring fairness (i.e., reverse coded) tend to focus on a willingness to engage in corrupt or even criminal behavior to advance your self-interest. Items measuring greed avoidance seem to be focused on concern with social status grounded in superficial things. Modesty items seems more like a measure of narcissism (i.e., believing you are better than others in some essential and vague way). Sincerity seems to have items concerned with a willingness to engage in social manipulation through flattery and guilt.This got me interested in the correlation between honest-humility and the dark triad: machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy.What are the best estimates of the correlation between HEXACO honesty-humility (and facets) with the Dark Triad?",

        "Some constructs in psychology are sometimes conceptualised ipsatively. I.e., where the sum of the scales adds up to a constant (e.g., personal values; coping styles). The aim of such measures is often to show the relative position on such scales. In some cases, such scales are created by their response format (e.g., participants respond to questions that require some form of rank ordering of constructs). However, it is also possible to score tests with normative items (e.g., 20 items each on 1 to 5 scale, measuring 4 constructs) in an ipsative way. However, I recently ran into confusion about exactly how such ipsatised scores should be computed. I can think of a few different ways (e.g., subtracting the mean across all items from each item; dividing scale scores by sum of scale scores; saving residuals where scale is predicted by total score, etc.). I imagine many of these approaches yield similar variables.

        "I'm having a hard time making a clear distinction between semantic and episodic memory. When presented with idealized examples, I find the breakdown clear; describing a trip to Paris is an example of episodic memory, describing the structure of a cell is an example of semantic memory.However, when it comes to experimental settings, things suddenly start to look more murky. For example, say that one is presented 20 words in a sequential fashion and then is asked to repeat as many of these as possible. Are we dealing with episodic memory then? Does it make any difference if one is forced to recollect them in the same order as they appeared? Many researchers seem to consider this situation an example of episodic memory (just as an example, see van der Helm et al., 2011), and indeed, the man who invented the concept of episodic memory also did so at the time of its conception (Tulving, 1972; p.390).However, later, Tulving has revised his original definition. In a more recent article (Tulving, 2002) he writes:I had been wrong in 1972 when I had assumed that the traditional, Ebbinghaus-inspired, study/test laboratory experiments of verbal learning and memory had dealt with episodic memory. They had not. Two important features of episodic memory were missing.One had to do with the contents of what the subjects in the experiments had to learn. Episodic memory is about happenings in particular places at particular times, or about “what,” “where,” and “when” [...] Traditional laboratory experiments, however, were almost invariably concerned with “what.” Subjects are asked, “What do you remember of the presented material?” They report their knowledge in tests such as free recall, cued recall, or recognition. Subjects’ memory for “where” and “when” was hardly ever examined.The other missing feature was what I referred to in Elements as “recollective experience,” or conscious awareness of what had happened in the past. In traditional experiments the experimenter assumes that the overt behavioral response reflects the subject’s mental state; that is, that behavior is a faithful index of cognition. The reasoning goes something like this: Surely, if the subject recognizes an item in a recognition test, it means that he remembers it from the list, that is, that he has a conscious recollection of the item’s occurrence in the study list. How could it possibly be otherwise?As subsequent history showed, it could be otherwise. Research on implicit memory [...], or so-called nonconscious memory [...], has overwhelmingly proved that one and the same behavioral response in a study/test experiment could represent conscious awareness of the retrieved item’s experimental history as readily as it could represent total lack of such awareness.So which one is it? Are there any large disagreements within the community of what episodic memory actually is? Are word list tests seen as something that at least captures a small part of episodic memory? If remembering a list of words isn't an example of episodic memory, then what is it an example of?References:van der Helm, E.; Gujar, N.; Nishida, M; Walker, M.P.

        "I am from Brazil – at the current moment, education in this country is undoubtedly poor. I've been learning some things over the years on my own, mostly downloading content from the internet and reading. Whenever I tell people (in my country) that I learn in such way, they usually say that I am an autodidact – and when arguing about this, they seem to imply that this is a unique feature for some special people that are born with this (they don't think that it's an ability that anyone could develop). However, I'm a little skeptical about this, and I'm expanding the reasons below:As I pointed out in the beginning, the education in our country is a failure. We're not taught how to think and develop solutions to problems with minimal information beforehand. Education is more of a fake spectacle provided by the government to pretend the country is a good place for international investors. Trying to learn after being a student that spent years in such a scheme is usually painful, and I say this from experience. Managing energy, motivation, discipline, systems for controlling procrastination, the idea that you yourself have to manage such features and other aspects of learning alone is hard.Our school gives us the impression that learning is linear and continuous, that there aren't pitfalls and that spending some days stuck with a problem means that one cannot learn something alone.When speaking with people from other countries, it seems utterly trivial to learn something alone. I've even gotten some syllabi from universities such as Cambridge and Oxford, and the way these syllabi are written seems to be made for a student that has been taught in a more sophisticated and independent way. They list the topics that need to be learned, they give the student a manual on how to study, and they give them the list of books – I'm finding it perfect to learn using their syllabi as a guide. On the other hand, the syllabi of Brazilian universities are terrible, they don't mention books, they don't mention a order for which the topics must be studied, they just list everything only with dates, and there's no guide for self-study: The syllabi seems to be made for a completely dependent student.Given the arguments above, I'd like to know: Is autodidactism really a unique, rare feature that I possess?

        "The neocortex is likely to process sparse representations in a hierarchy with information close to the raw sensor input appearing in lower levels and abstract concepts being appearing in higher levels. However, I'm interested in the exact nature of information being passed upwards.There are some gating mechanisms in the neocortex. I could imagine that they prevent obvious information from being passed up. For example, since it was already reported and didn't changed. Much like workers within corporate hierarchies only report the same status once.Similarly, it would make sense to pass up information that a lower layer doesn't understand and can't handle itself. This would also be comparable to workers at a company who ask their managers for decision they can't make.If planning happens within the hierarchy of the neocortex, higher layers might hand down high levels options for the lower levels to unroll and simulate. In that case, the result might be passed up afterwards.Encoding continuous input streams, attractor patterns are likely to emerge within levels of the hierarchy. I could imagine that the type of information send upwards changes when a level settles in a stable pattern.Is there any evidence for or against these guesses? What else know about the nature of information that's passed up within the neocortex?",

The results are activation patterns with single neurons firing for the existence of specific higher level patterns. Those sparse representations are passed upward to the next higher layer.For example, there is a neuron firing whenever there is a face in the scene. On this higher level, neurons are not restricted to a small window of our field of view anymore. My question is how those high level sparse representations still retain information about positions and counts of objects.One bad explanation would be that there are neurons representing counts in general. If three and face are both active, there are three faces in the scene. But this doesn't hold for two kinds of objects at the same time since it's not clear which count is for which object. And what if both have the same count.",

        "From my understanding, the neocortex performs both perception and imagination/planning within the same hierarchical structure. During perception, an area of the neocortex receives current input from sensors and decides on motor actions to execute. During imagination, an area replays previous inputs, or operates on potential future inputs for planning. Actions don't actually get executed during planning.On the one hand, it seems like both perception and planning are in part executed by the same neural structures. It seems intuitive that the same abstraction mechanism needs to be reused to arrive at the same high-level representations. On the other hand, it seems like the brain still needs to distinguish between them, for example to not executed imagined actions.The two processes certainly affect each other. Perceiving a difficult situation can cause planning, perception can cause an association to imagine another situation, or imagination sets filters on what we perceive. Are there any explanations if and how the neocortex implements both perception and imagination/planning within the same structures?Are perception and imagination states that the neocortex areas switch between, or can they be carried out simultaneously? Can multiple areas be involved in planning at the same time? When an area sends information to another one, how does it signal whether this was perceived or imagined information?

I'm thinking of brainwave-processing algorithms. For example in Actigraphy, the study of human motion, there are algorithms like if 19 out of 20 minutes of activity are scored as sleep, then the sleep onset is known to happen at the start of the 20 minute window. Is there something similar for brainwave or derived metrics? ",
        "I'm wondering if the human brain predicts how certain weeks of the year should feel? For example, a child who is going to school may have a more positive affect in anticipation of summer holidays, and may feel more negatively towards the end of the summer, as he/she knows that freedom and fun are about to end. Another example may be siblings' or parents' birthdays, where the anticipation of the birthday increases positive affect.I'm wondering if year after year of such patterns (in childhood, the teenage years and maybe young adolescence) can create an association in the brain between positive/negative affect and the specific time of the year, or specific photoperiod duration (day length). What I'm trying to understand is, if a pattern of such ups and downs that may have been established in the childhood persists throughout adulthood?Have there been any studies that looked at the previous life history and incidence of mania/depression episodes in bipolar disorder, or the onset of depression in Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD), and correlated them with holidays, birthdays, etc? I've read that SAD may manifest a depression in any season, not just winter, which got me thinking of the possible causes. ",
        "I have limited experience feeding wildlife, and while it's fun to watch and I'm sure fun for the wildlife too, I'm interested in just how much fun.  Is there's any noticeable difference in the following scenarios?Scenario A: a bird is given a pile of food, and can eat it at any pace.Scenario B: an element of play or competition is introduced. The birdhas to seek out seeds that are scattered on the ground, or has to compete with other birds. Alternatively, a challenging bird feeder is used.The end result is that there's enough food to satiate the bird in either case. It seems that in scenario B, it would take longer for the bird to get full. In scenario B, the bird has to hop from one cluster of seeds to the next, picking out the ones that the bird wants. There may be additional birds, also competing for the tastiest seeds. Alternatively, the bird has to balance on the birdfeeder, and coordinate precise movements to retrieve a seed from the feeder.If the bird is observed over the next X minutes or hours following the feeding, is there any noticeable difference in the overall demeanor, activity pattern, etc., between the two scenarios?UPDATE: I originally thought that this question does not apply to humans - we all sit at a table and eat meals from dishes, etc. I couldn't ask a question about kids throwing pie, which is what I thought of when I think play with food. But this evening, as I was deseeding a pomegranate, I realized that humans may like Playing with difficult fruit too PomegranateCitrus (oranges/grapefruit)PineappleGetting to the best parts of these fruit can be turned into a game too. For example, deseeding pomegranate can be done with the minimum amount of juice splashing, while an orange peel can be removed in many ways as well.The scenarios above can be modified to be easily applicable to humans too:Scenario A: Given unlimited supply of whole pomegranates to deseedScenario B: Given an unlimited supply of pomegranate seeds on a plateWhich person will leave the table feeling better? To get a sense of how people may play with the fruits above, search google for Peel an orange, and you will find very varying screenshots. ",
        "A few years ago I was interviewing for a position with a subdivision of a large company in New York City. One of the things that hit me as odd about this interview was that the recruiter was interested in my driving record and wanted to know if I have any traffic violations.Is there any connection between a safe driving record and personality traits or other psychometric test scores? Can anything about a person's personality (e.g., agreeableness, neuroticism, or lawfulness) be understood by looking at the person's driving record?In this context, safe driving record only refers to the absence of recorded infringements. For example, a person who engages in unsafe driving but for whatever reason does not get caught, would still have a safe driving record.",
        "This afternoon I've been observing people at a local park and came up with some observations that lead me to this question:Can the person's gait (manner of walking) say something about the person's internal experience at that moment? I'm thinking of arousal and cognition.For example:Have you ever seen a businessman or an office worker walk? They walk with a purpose, quite energetically with the body slightly inclined forward. Is it feasible to say that when such walk is observed, the person is going somewhere, and may be tense?A child may be running around with arms in the air, along an irregular path. Can it be said that such child is energetic and excited at that moment?Two elderly people may walk very differently. One couple walks at a regular pace of 3-4mph, while another couple may push one foot in front of the other at 0.5 mph. Can this tell us anything about the differences in the mental activity that takes place within these people?A person may be strolling slowly at It appears to me that in the examples above, the person's mood/demeanor and  motion are connected. I'm interested if there's really any correlation between how a person appears outwardly and how the person feels? In other words, if one is tense and feels pressed for time, would one start to walk with a purpose, as opposed to strolling casually?Thank you for your input.",

I did a search and found that there are several applied cognitive science labs at various psychology departments in the US.

        "Some time ago, I've read that the most significant people in a person's life have their own internal representation/model of within the person's mind. For example:An internal representation of a spouseAn internal representation of parents, grandparentsAn internal representation of childrenClose friends, etcThis representation does not matter, until the connection is severed - the significant person dies or moves away. This is when there's no more input from the real world - only the internal representation remains. For example, it is possible to dream of an interaction with a deceased relative. My question is about whatever phenomenon causes people to be able to dream and interact with people previously known, while in a dream. I'm interested if there has been research that confirms that people do indeed have unique internal models of significantly close relatives? If so, what is the correct term to use when searching for scientific information on the subject?Update: In particular, I'm interested in unique internal representations - linked to a unique object in real life. Do they exist?For example, there is only one spouse. Jane Smith. Has there been evidence that the internal representation of Jane Smith is unique (every single time Jane Smith is encountered, it is the same representation, possibly lighting up the same region of the brain if viewed with imaging techniques).

        "Most of the regular waking cognition experiences a continuous visual field. One object of focus flows into another. Objects out of focus are pushed to the periphery. A person may move one's view around in a 360 degree sphere, but from a single point in space. For example, moving eyes away from the monitor towards the desk keeps the monitor in the field of view, just moves it to the periphery.Now, as I'm looking at modern day (2012) movies and commercials, I notice that a lot of them feature abrupt changes from one image to another, from one camera angle to another. It is as if the perspective shifts about in space.Quite a lot of these image changes are very brief - just a few seconds long. For example, a conversation on screen may have camera on one actor talking, then jump to show the other actor's reaction, then snap back. Commercials are even worse - if viewed out of the corner of one's eye, they frequently appear as just a series of flashes.I'm interested if there's any science behind these abrupt changes in camera angles and flashes of images. For example, I know that a human eye needs about 25 frames per second to perceive fluid motion on the screen. A refresh rate of 60 hertz is the minimum to avoid eye strain. Are there any similar numbers related to the duration of exposure to the stimulus, for example(fake numbers):0.75 seconds to capture emotion on the human's face2 seconds to comprehend action (ex: car driving on screen)3 seconds flash of explosion is enough to produce excitement14 seconds to become familiar with the scene",
        "I'm thinking of a phenomenon that I've first observed in myself when taking an IQ test. Upon looking at the question, I selected an answer, but got this gut feeling or a hint that something was wrong with my response. Upon seeing the answers, the question was indeed answered incorrectly. I've observed this phenomenon several more times in different situations and can define it as a very quick flash of awareness or feeling that quickly subsides.What is the neuroscience behind such gut feelings or intuitions? I'm particularly interested if such almost answers are some form of cognitive process, where some neurons fire, but not enough to produce a fully formed insight/idea/judgement.Because the question that I was originally trying to answer was not lexical, but involved some rational thinking, I do not believe that this is exactly the tip of the tongue phenomenon.",
        "I have long had interest in dreaming, and one of the defining features of ordinary dreams is that the dreamer either accepts the dream as real life, or does not question the surroundings.Compare these ordinary dreams with lucid dreams, or conscious dreaming, where the person is aware of the fact that he/she is dreaming. Within an ordinary dream, a person goes with the flow, while within a lucid dream, the person can think clearly and act voluntarily without waking up.Have these been any studies that used fMRI or other techniques to try to determine what is it within the human brain that causes the distinction between conscious and ordinary dreaming?

        "I've been reading an old popular psychology book by russian psychiatrist Vladimir Levi. One of the things that he has his depressed patients try is learn to juggle. He insists that such activity brings both halves of the brain together and that the brain likes to juggle. His book was written in the 1980s, and there's little science presented in the book to back the claim.Juggling involves coordinating both hands and is automatic, if I understand correctly. Touch typing involves coordinating 10 fingers together and is also automatic once learned.In the 1990s and early 2000s, computer keyboards were the dominant way of inputting data into a computer. If one was to type anything one used both hands together for extended periods of time (most likely touch typing with both hands). But as of 2013, more and more people report using tablet PCs to surf the web and interact with friends online. Such typing most likely involves one finger pressing the letters on a virtual keyboard. It's a much slower process, as the keyboard is too small for both hands. Does touch-typing has any cognitive benefits? Is the effect lost if one reverts to typing with a single finger? ",
        "I got a commercial-grade EEG headband and am trying to look at the data it outputs. The headband quantifies raw EEG signal from a single forehead dry sensor into a range of EEG bands (alpha, beta, etc). The issue that I'm running into is that the values of the EEG bands jump rather significantly from one data point to the next (0.05 second reading intervals). Additionally, there are eye-related artifacts.I would like to apply some sort of algorithm or statistical analysis to see how the EEG bands behave over some time interval.  I'm hoping to see if some EEG band statistically rises or is suppressed over 5-15min time period. Seeing instantaneous jumps in individual readings does not convey this information. For example, I know that for Actigraphic studies, there are sleep scoring algorithms, like one by Cole that looks at the previous 4 minutes, the current minute and 2 minutes in the future to score a minute of actigraphy data:  SleepScoreConstant*(550*4minAgo + 378*3minAgo + 413*2minAgo + 699*1minAgo +1736*CurrentMinute  + 287*1minAhead + 309*2minAhead)Are there some similar algorithms for EEG band analysis?Alternatively, it would help if you can suggest the realistic time window over which EEG bands may be statistically analyzed in awake subjects: is it 20 seconds? 5 minutes? 90 minutes?

        "I'm thinking of a way to describe what's happening to a single channel EEG/MEG sensor output. I've noticed that there is significant difference in the readings from a quiet observations, versus a person who's engaged in a conversation. I'm looking for some way to quantify the two distinct states, so a computer algorithm may have a chance of distinguishing the two. Potentially, in the future I would like to compare readings from one individual to the next, or compare the arousal of two individuals engaged in a conversation.It would be helpful to know what are the names of metrics that may be used to measure the overall arousal/excitation of a person, that person's nervous system or brain. I can think of Actigraphy (the study of human motion) as one, its units are arbitrary activity count, or m/s^3. These are scored as zero point crossings, or area under the curve of an accelerometer graph. But are there any other metrics or units of human activity/excitation? Maybe some of them are related to an EEG/EMG readings? Like an obscure algorithm named after some scientist?",
        "I've long been interested in dreaming and there's a peculiar phenomenon of the very start of the dreaming process. Different people experience it differently, but even for the same person there's anecdotal evidence of different experiences during dreaming onset.One of the most dramatic examples is the wake induced lucid dreaming transition, where the subject experiences intense hallucinations. These could be sight, sound, feeling of presence, falling, buzzing, etc. As these hallucinations subside, they are replaced by dream imagery.There are other kinds of transitions as well.What interests me is if these phenomena have been studied using modern neuroimaging techniques. Does science know what happens in the brain when the persons perception shifts from the real world to dreaming mentations?",
        "I'm not sure if nose touching is a scientifically-validated signature of deception or internal conflict. For the purposes of this question I would assume that it's fairly common knowledge in psychology that people touch nose or cover the mouth when saying something part of them does not believe to be true.If nose touching is encountered in a regular,spontaneous conversation, then it may be deduced that the statement that the person just made is untrue (or the person does not really believe it). For example: I can easily make money on the stock market. If such statement is followed by a nose touch, I can assume that the person is at least partially unsure about the content of the statement. Now, when I'm watching prepared talks, like on Ted.com, the following question arises: If a person has prepared a speech in advance,rehearsed it and is now delivering a prepared speech, does nose touching have any predictive component for deception? In other words, if a person touches a nose during a prepared speech, is it a sign of deception/internal uncertainty that just happened or one that is about to happen?I know that there are fMRI studies that found some actions can be predicted x milliseconds in advance, and I'm interested if nose touching is one of things that can predict something that is about to happen, not indicate something that just happened.

        "I'm interested in sleep research, and sometimes in conversations with people the following idea gets discussed: A person becomes aware at a certain time in the morning and feel great(while still in bed). But the wake up time is later, so that person keeps sleeping and the feeling is gone. It's much harder to get out of bed. The general pattern is that there's a perceived good time to get out of bed, but people oversleep it.From my understanding, the second part of this statement is caused by sleep inertia, where a person slips into deeper sleep(slow wave sleep SWS) stages. But what about the perceived perfect wake up time?What sleep stage or sequence of sleep stages, if any is associated with this feeling of energy in the morning(NREM1,2?)?is this feeling associated with light exposure (ex: 20 minutes after light exposure)does it happen every day, for all people?Is there some  deep sleep hormone (probably not melatonin) that gets released in deeper sleep stages and produces sleep inertia?There are a couple very successful sleep apps for smartphones that are marketed for this principle (they advertise the ability to find this best wake up time for you) and hundreds of imitations (smart alarm clocks). But is there really a phenomenon like I'm describing above, or is it a rare glitch of the endocrine system or something?",

One person knows another one, that one another one, and in the end you are connected through intermediate connections.I'm interested if something similar exists for ideas - does human mind naturally connect and infer from different ideas to find a relationship between ideas? I'm thinking about this in the context of Freudian dream interpretation. In his book on the analysis of dreams, Freud repeatedly lists examples where he uses analysis and logic to find meaning in dream imagery and experiences.This makes me curious if what Freud has discovered is some function of memory or thinking that establishes connections between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones.For example, there is no connection between cats and space flight. But ones mind may try to connect them through a cartoon episode which involved super intelligent cats from the outer space invading earth in spaceships. Now there is a connection between cats and space flight.What I'm trying to ask is if it is natural for the mind to bridge gaps between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones, especially if/when a person is actively looking for a connection? if there are 6 jumps between two unrelated ideas/concepts, then there are 6 degrees of separation.",

For example, I'm thinking of peasants of ye olde days, who had to work really hard to get by, or early factory workers, who apparently did 12+ hour shifts from a very early age. Those people had no drugs or cognitive-behavior therapy to correct their issues.

        "I'm very interested in dreaming and have pretty good dream recall. This makes me able to recall and distinguish hundreds of experience within my memory and label them as dreams. I'm trying to understand if there's indeed some feature of a dream memory that makes it different from an ordinary waking memory?Upon reflection on my personal experiences, it appears to me that when I recall a waking life memory, typically the process is two fold and sequential - first recall the scene then recall the action and combine the two. For example: I was sitting in a room at a local hackerspace + I was talking to fellow hackers there. I can then proceed to try to recall pieces of that conversation. This process seems sequential to me.However, when I recall the dream memory, it seems that I recall both place and action at the same time, together, with a typically longer sequence of events all recalled much quicker. For example: I was locked in a room with no exit and has created a portal in the wall to escape from the room, flying out of a portal in some other location.  These events are recalled all together, in less than a second, and are clearly identified as a dream along with the recall. The content of that dream, although clearly non-real is similar to a video game called Portal that I played on a computer in the waking life. I can recall the waking life expeirence of playing that game, although in a linear fashion.Has there been any brain imaging studies or other evidence that supports the idea that the recall of dreams is different from the recall of waking life experiences?",

Freud provides on example where an event took place months before the dream.My question is: Has there been any research that explained why there can be a long (4-7 days) delay between a real life event and a dream with elements from the event?Just to clarify, these are not recurring dreams, but single occurrence dreams about past experiences.

I believe that Freud himself, in his book mentions that before him people were evaluating dreams as various influences of spirits or divines.

Unless a person knows how to mitigate the effect, the negative emotion is likely to stay with the person for minutes to hours.This makes me ask - What are there opposite of insults for the purposes of triggering positive emotion that lingers on afterwards?

To get rid of rats, people introduced  cats that instead of hunting rats killed off the entire island's bird  population.The explanation given is that birds could not recognize cats as predators and/or did not have natural predators in the environment. This made me think - is there any part of a bird that on a genetic level knows that some other organism is a predator and is to be avoided?For animals that live surrounded by predators, for example a house sparrow - how does a bird learn that cats are predators, but squirrels are not? An example might help illustrate my question: Let's say someone takes house sparrows from America and breeds them for 3 generations on the same tropical island with no predators - would such 3rd generation sparrow still recognize cats as predators?",
        "A rather basic question, but I don't see answer in Google, so here it goes: Humans have thoughts, sometimes these thoughts carry with them motivations to act, urges, cravings, etc. All these can make a person start moving to accomplish something.   For example: I'm rather bored, I think I will go get a snack. What  happens the moment I cross the threshold from thinking to actually  getting up to get a snack?What happens the moment the person starts to act based on a thought? Where in the human brain does a thought trigger action?Update: In response to an answer suggesting that in many cases action comes first and rationalization for action comes second:The kind of action that I'm talking about comes after a longer period deliberation, where the current state is being weighted against the benefit of the action to take.For example in the situations below, a person can deliberate for minutes:A person is in bed and is very close to sleep, being comfortable and relaxed. Loud noises from the outside disturb the person's attempt to fall asleep. In this case the person can experience conflict between staying in bed (comfortable but disturbed) or going to find earplugs / shut the windows (uncomfortable, but potentially lessening the disturbance)A person is trying to meditate, thus relaxing the body and unfocusing the mind. An itch on the foot is disturbing the meditation. Such person can either continue the current state while ignoring the discomfort or scratch the itch and potentially lose the meditative state.In the examples above, two conflicting courses of action are evaluated by the brain. Due to the ongoing discomfort, it is possible to stay in this state of almost making a decision for quite some time.  At a certain point the scale can tip into taking action to resolve the discomfort. What is it that causes the person to take action as opposed to inaction?",
        "I'm interested in what is the mechanism that explains the recurrence or looping of thoughts within a person's mind. Unless very strongly distracted, such thoughts can creep up back or mutate slightly while maintaining the same overall theme - action is required. From my understanding both positive and negative thoughts can loop, although thoughts with the themes of fear, anxiety, compulsion or desire can be more disturbing when looping. What is the mechanism behind looping or recurring thoughts? In particular I'm interested if such thoughts are chemically induced through a release of some kind of neuromodulator (like fight or flight response is based on Adrenaline).A few examples, where rational thought is used to counter irrational fear or anxiety thought:Did I forget to do X? I really have to go to Y, but what if I did not do X?[Imagination a horrible scenario when X is not done]I better go check on X.Check on X reassures the person, resulting in no new thoughts creeping in.What interests me is what happens when the person either cannot go and check or will incur significant cost for doing so (ex: being late to work) or will try to resist the urge to check. In this case recurring thoughts can eventually reemerge and start to invade one's awareness:Did I forget to turn the stove off?I really have to go to work.But the house can burn down I believe that nothing bad will come out of itYou can't know thatThe stove has a pilot light - gas will just keep burningBut the cat can jump on a stove and get burntCat is smarter than thatBut the house can burn downYou can become homelessDo you have fire insurance?[Repeat/mutate]",
        "I'm interested in how significant events from daily life get encoded or translated into dream content. A personal observation can help clarify my question:  I've observed that for me, significant, futile mental effort  translates into dreams of me being in a classroom in my old middle  school. The kind of mental effort dictated which classroom I will see  - history, language or math.It took me years to make the connection, as the frequency of the dream was rather high while attending school and college. It is only after I started working that I noticed dreams of classrooms were gone and only reappeared following intense, but perceived as pointless mental effort to learn or grasp or produce something. I'm familiar with the Freud's theories on how wish fulfillment and repressed sexual desires show up in dreams. On the other hand I'm aware of the much discredited concept of dream interpretation with dictionaries of dream symbols.Have there been studies that lay in between the two extremes listed above and attempted to elicit connections between daily events and how they appear in dreams? Maybe attempts to create personal dream dictionaries, like the one I described in the example?"

While there might be some variation based on the circumstances and the individuals involved, I feel like a one or a few techniques should always dominate the list. The effectiveness of techniques that deal with different cognitive issues is most likely somwhat geometrically distributed (all else being equal), i.e., most of the time they obey the power law (most techniques are moderately effective, but a few are really effective).  In particular I'm currently interested in effective techniques for willpower. I'm aware of which techniques are recommended (split a task into subtasks, positive self-talk and many more), but what are their relative effectiveness? Are there some well-executed studies out there that determined which techniques work comparatively better?What are effective and generalizable self-regulatory skills and strategies?How do their relative efficacy compare?",
        "As an example of an artificial neural net (ANN), a neural processing unit (NPU) is able to encode previous (learned) information by storing a weighted resistance for each input. Since ANN's are biologically inspired, I was wondering whether the neurons in the human brain also have a mechanism to set the resistance for electrical current that flows through the neuron. If not, how is information (long term storage) encoded in the brain (for example, a familiar word like house)? ",
        "It's my understanding that brain activity in the prefrontal cortex is suppressed during sleep and that mindfulness stimulates activity in that region. Based on this, it seems counterintuitive to think that the average person who is lying in bed and using mindfulness meditation reduces his/her sleep latency. Is there any empirical indication or theoretical argument either way?",
        "I want to emphasize that I'm not referring to the intense mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), but instead just 10-20 minutes of daily mindfulness meditation (MM), perhaps guided by a smartphone app.It's usually claimed that MM leads to improvements in the prefrontal cortex (enhanced focus, working memory etc.) and the amygdala (reduced depression, anxiety, stress etc.).  I have read recent studies claiming that mindfulness meditation is no more effective than watching a documentary, is counterproductive at work etc. (Some of these studies may have been context-specific.) Anecdotally, I've done MM myself on-and-off for several years and didn't notice any significant improvements in the areas listed above.  Due to publication bias, p-hacking, the reproducibility crisis etc. and my own personal experience, I'm skeptical that MM does anything significant (noticeable changes) and/or lasting (after the meditation, during the day).  Is there a large-scale, pre-registered replication effort to support the benefits of 'casual' MM (i.e., not the more intense MBCT)?",
        "Some modern activities exploit the primitive mammalian reward areas in the brain. They include immediate access to social media, video games, music, sugar, pornographic material, gambling etc. Worse, excessively engaging in these activities without inhibition may enhance the neuroplasticity of the reward centers (and undermine the plasticity of areas involved in self-control, including the anterior cingulate cortex), thus leading to long-term changes of higher reward tolerance, lower self-regulatory abilities, and other exacerbating effects. Unfortunately, most worthwhile work (e.g., proactive learning, writing, thinking about new mechanisms and concepts etc.) usually doesn't offer nearly as much dopaminergic stimulation in the mammalian reward centers of the human brain. Next to the obvious mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., being aware of the moment and noting the emotional occupation) and cognitive behavioral therapy based approaches (CBT), what interventions have proven to be effective or are likely to be effective for the use case below (*)? References to support these techniques are welcome. Perhaps some techniques from the substance abuse literature has some application. The main focus of this question mostly deals with the following situation:  (*) An adult is currently engaging in the addictive task and wishes to context-switch to the productive task. Additionally, the person is aware that the current (addictive) task offers a lower expected utility than the productive task. "

However, the cases that I am interested in are when people developed schizophrenia and then they made the greatest contributions to their fields. I have also noticed similar trends with illnesses such as epilepsy.All three, Nietzsche,Van Gogh and Guy de Maupassant were creative despite having a mental illness.

        "Background. It happens often that, at the end of the day when I return to home, I try to recall past events that took place that day or the day before (memory rehearsal), but surprisingly I find that I have lost almost all details about some of them: while some  details are kept in good state, other are altered (false memory: wrong order of events, memory gaps, inconsistent and incoherent memories), and the rest are forgotten! Boundaries between details are blurred! Such things happen when I'm tired. On the one hand, if I don't try to recall events, e.g. when I postpone such practice to a later moment (after resting), I will forget some details as I have wasted time.On the other hand, when I try to rehearse some memories that happened the same day, it seems that the biological state of tiredness affects the ability to recall in such a manner that details become altered and false memories are produced (again a loss of information)!

        "Background:  All of us have dreams at night, and I believe that all of us wonder how a dream of a lapse of seconds could convince our consciousness that this has taken the span of a lifetime.As far as I know, the REM phase – in which we have dreams – does not take more than 20 min, while we can feel after a dream that it's a year after the last time we have been awake...Please correct me if I'm wrong.Another interesting aspect in dreams is that space and time are subject to distortion, and the capacities of the mind to handle information is far away from its capacities in the awakened state, so the acuity with which someone can paradoxically resolve problems while asleep is no wonder, and by that I mention lucid dreaming.Drugs can alter our capacities to perceive our environments and ourselves, so that someone can ignore even the worst feeling of pain while he is taking barbiturates for instance, and the point of this is that what can be illogical within some context can be possible and therefore logical in another context.Not to mention that hypnosis can bring a hidden aspect of our personality to higher levels of consciousness, make someone think he is another person or even another thing and so on...I wonder if it is possible to provoke a state that is similar to lucid dreaming in a person that is awake...The idea is intuitive, even childish, and I received a comment that it's not logical, as lucid dreaming while awake contradicts the definition of awakened/sleep states...Of course this should be illogical at the first glance, but that is the point of my question.I hope I found the right words to explain my idea...My question:Is it possible to provoke a fusion between dreams and reality so that our brains handle information of the real world in the same way as it happens in dreams?",

        "I’ve taken a course on counselling psychology and have attended a counselling sessions myself. All the literature I’ve read has said counsellors should not give advice. My question is why is this possible? I know when talking to a counsellor they think they’re being self-empowering by not “giving advice” or asking leading questions, but I don’t believe it’s possible to have a neutral conversation with someone where they have no effect over you. In a sense, is the way councillors/psychologists speaking to people actually underhanded as they try to dress-up advice as non-advice? I know at advance stages of counselling the counsellor is supposed to challenge the client’s incongruent views. Which views the councillor challenges are up to him, so that’s exerting change on the client. Wouldn't it be better for a councillor to clearly say what he thinks instead of trying to trick a client into thinking they came up with the idea?For example if a counsellor says “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend” while this may be a fact, the councillor is trying to steer you in a certain direction. Wouldn’t it be more honest to say “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend, maybe you should breakup with her?” even though the breaking up bit is considered advice?UPDATE: I think I've finally found the words to express what I'm thinking. I know councilors are not supposed to give advice and act in a very neutral way as to allow the client to sort things out for them self, as this is seen as self empowering. It's been my observation that councilors (inadvertently) just find ways to mask what they are asserting as a question or a seemingly neutral statement. For example, client my neighbor was parked in my drive way and it made me late for work, councilor I could see how that would make a person mad (this implies the correct response would be mad). client: my date cancelled on me, councilor do you feel let down? (this is planting the idea in his head). Now wouldn't it be better if the councilor gave advice like there are plenty of fish in the sea. I know councilors are not trained to ask leading questions or make leading comments, but as humans, I believe it is inevitable to do this, and it's much better just to say something directly than to (subconsciously) think up a way to hint at it.",

Reward contingencies can change from trial to trial.List memory: Given a list of any length, Spaun should reproduce it.Counting: Counting.

An egotist is a person whose ego is greatly  influenced by the approval of others while a narcissist is not.    Allocentrism is a collectivistic personality attribute whereby people  center their attention and actions on other people rather than  themselves.But since the prosocial actions are often motivated by ego needs (see Polatch effect for the extreme) can we say that among extreme idealistic people (i.e. militants in extreme organizations) we can find Narcissists as well?

(1996) paper on behavioural priming, subjects in an experimental group were shown word primes recalling stereotypes of old age (e.g. forgetful), while subjects in a controlg group were shown neutral words. Everyone's walking speed as they left the experiment was measured, and because the first group's was slower, it was concluded that priming people with words relating to a certain concept (in this case: old age) makes them unconsciously take on characteristics of that concept (in this case: walking more slowly).The question that comes to my mind is, however: how do we know that the mean difference in walking speed is not just due to pre-existing (baseline) differences between the groups? How can we be sure it is due to the IV manipulation (different word primes)? To me, believable evidence for this claim would be if they had measured everyone's speed pre&post-experiment, and then found an interaction showing that, while controls' speed stayed the same pre-to-post, that of the old-age-primed group had decreased.

My question is: what sense does it make to speak of very high IQ scores, such as for instance 170, that correspond to an extreme in the distribution's tail, when, if one were to convert back to raw scores, this would seem to result in a raw score higher than the one corresponding to an all answers correct result.Put more simply, my question is: since there is a hard-limit on raw scores, why is it that the normal distribution used to describe an IQ score can (theoretically) lead, along its tails, to infinitely-large numbers - as well as, conversely, to negative numbers - as raw scores, both extremes being out of the raw-scores range?",

        "A good friend of mine is a clinical psychologist. She has been in practice for more then 25 years and has provided psychological help to people for a variety of issues. One of her specialities is ADHD. She has created what cognitive psychologists call a process model  (ie flow chart model; see Cognitive Psychology by Goldstein for definition) for how ADHD could work as well as solutions for how to correct it based on her expect experience with her patients. She thus helps people successfully adapt to having the disorder by training them using her model.All she has at the moment is a model, but she feels very confident publishing this model could help other since it has been successful in her clinical work. She is capable of organizing these ideas into arguments suitable for academic discourse and likely could also find peers to help edit her work. But she must find a journal that would be interested in publishing her model.I myself do not know much about publishing in psychology and am more familiar with biology and physics. However, from talking to my physicist friends, I have learned there are a lot of changes going on in how articles are published and correspondingly what opportunities are available. She has not considered publishing until recently (last few years) and is trying to get a better sense of what avenues would be appropriate / sensible. My Question:What kind of journal might be suitable for my friend to attempt to submit to? Note: The main purpose of this question is to (1) get more information about trends in how publishing works in psychology journals and (2) to get information specifically about what cognitive psychology journals (specifically those who accept process models) look for in accepting papers.

        "I was reading Danny K's recent book for fun (Thinking Fast and Slow, 2011), and he suggests briefly that some people's reliance on their intuitions (i.e., System 1) might sometimes indicate a sort of aversion to cognitive effort (i.e., System 2).  For example, if you give a participant Joe a tricky problem that has an intuitive but false answer, Joe might not think too hard about the question, so he'll just give his (false) intuition.  In this case, Joe does not attempt elaborative processing or sustained cognitive effort (i.e., engaging System 2) because he has learned that this can be unpleasant and/or tiring.  Thus he relies on his intuition and gets the question wrong.While there are probably many alternative explanations for Joe's behavior, it seems that aversion to mental effort could be one.

Viewers see an aggressive large triangle bullying a smaller triangle,  a terrified circle, the circle and the small triangle joining forces  to defeat the bully.Viewers perceive the movements of the shapes in causal terms.

(I think)The “aggression strategy”, on the other hand, seems to involve involves taking determined action to conquer something that we believe to be causing the stress.I am guessing that hormones like adrenaline and maybe testosterone are involved in this process but I’m not sure.What is actually happening neurochemically when we get aggressive?I believe that serotonin is involved in both strategies.Serotonin being the neurochemical that is released when we have confidence that our needs can be met.I believe that both the connection and aggression strategies seek to reduce cortisol and increase serotonin, but I would really like to understand exactly how this works.Especially for the case of aggression.",

Or perhaps improve the explanation.My intuition is that diffused mode is about making associations.i.e. Noticing how things are similar.When we learn something new, we try to associate it to something we already know.Like maybe when you see a pomelo for the first time, you might associate it to a grapefruit.My intuition is that focused mode is about making discernments.i.e. Noticing how things are different.For example, a pomelo is different than a grapefruit in several ways:It's bigger.It's inner skin is thicker.  I think the process of learning the concept of pomelo then involves refining a sparse distributed representation of the object in the brain.A sparse distributed representation is just a bunch of neurons that fire together to signify the thought of a unique concept.So learning involves starting with a sparse distributed representation for an existing concept that we are familiar with, and then making changes to that representation via discernment until we have a new unique sparse distributed representation for our new concept.Is this correct?",
        "To be precise, by evil I am referring specifically tothe weakness of the trait of (or compulsion) for “genuine care and concern for the wellbeing of others”with respect tothe strength of the trait of (or compulsion for) the pursuit of self-interest.Or, more succinctly, the weakness of the force of conscience as a constraining force on the predatory compulsion of self-interest.“The battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of everyman. ~Aleksandr SolzhenitsynSome humans seem to lack this “genuine care and concern for the wellbeing of others”Of those who do, there seem to be at least 2 distinct groups:1: Those who lack it permanently. (irredeemably evil)2: Those who lack it only temporarily. (temporary insanity)By temporary insanity I am referring to the phenomenon of people who seem to act without care and concern for the well being of others, but who seem to do so because they lack the ability to control their fear at the time and are later genuinely remorseful for their behavior.By irredeemably evil I am referring to those who never experience any genuine remorse for such behavior.Difficulty #1: The seeming absence of a single underlying causePsychopathy is probably the best example of irredeemable evil. There are methods like the PCL-R to detect this particular type of evil. However, there seems to be growing evidence that narcissism also has a strong heritable component. The methods for detecting psychopathy do not seem to be applicable to narcissism.To add to the difficulty of the problem, the evidence would seem to suggest that the absence of moral constraint to predatory compulsions may not have a single cause.For example, there is some evidence to suggest that psychopathy may be the result of weak pain signals in general.One interpretation of this is that conscience emerges and is strengthened by the process of persistent pain giving rise to rumination. i.e. When our actions harm others, the persistent guilt that we feel, gives rise to a resolve to change our behavior both to relieve the pain in the moment and to avoid feeling this pain again in the future. However, if the pain signal is too weak to give rise to rumination, then the conscience does not form.On the other hand, narcissists seem to typically have normal levels of pain for themselves but lack the affective empathy which would trigger similar levels of pain when other humans are suffering. One interpretation of this is that the persistent pain which gives rise to the rumination which gives rise to conscience does not arise, due not to the inability to experience pain in general, but rather to the inability to experience pain of others due to the absence of affective empathy.Given these different ways in which the growth of conscience can be interrupted, it's possible that the most effective means of discernment between irredeemable evil an temporary insanity might be to identify the traits of those who have a fully developed conscience and look for the absence of those traits in the individual in question.Difficulty #2: Variance in the size of the circle of genuine care and concern.To further add to the difficulty of this problem, it seems that the size of the circle of genuine care and concern varies considerably amongst humans.For some, it extends only to kin.For others it might extend to a larger tribe.For others still, it might, as some religions would encourage us, extend to all humans or even all living beings.To be more precise, therefore,given that evil is the perception of the absence of genuine care and concern for the well being of others,and that those who lack genuine care and concern for the well being of others will feel compelled to fake it in order to survive and thrive in society,this question seems to break down into the following 2 components:1: pre-discovery: What is the most accurate method that potential prey can use to detect that the care and concern displayed by the skilled predator is, in fact, a deception?2: post-discovery: Having witnessed evidence of the absence of genuine care and concern for the well being of others, what is the most accurate means of determining if this is due to a permanent versus temporary inability to expand the circle of care and concern?"

On some rare ocassions what you had done would get to the news and you will be highly exposed on the whole country, but it would be extremely strange than more than that would happen.But now if you make something unusual, there are plenty of people that could record what you are doing and you cannot possibly be aware of everyone, and if you are caught and the video of you is uploaded, for example, to a good bunch of social networks, you are in danger of hundreds of millions of people watching what you have done.So this looks as a good reason for an increase of social phobia cases.Are there some studies that confirm my hypothesis?Thanks.",

        "We know that  alcohol negatively influences a driver's ability to drive. Governments typically combat this by making drunk driving illegal, and use the concentration of alcohol in breath or blood as the definitive measure as to whether a crime has been committed or not. In this sense - alcohol in the blood/breath is merely a proxy for impairment, but one that is quite reliable - when one is drunk they're going to show alcohol in the blood stream, this is able to be accurately measured.  There are other ways a driver can be impaired as well - quite commonly through sleepiness/fatigue, but also other drugs, or distraction (driving while texting), or emotional distress. The prospect of 'drugged driving' comes up quite commonly in discussions about legalising cannabis. Where there is a reliable test of alcohol impairment - it's not quite the same for cannabis and other drugs - the problem being that saliva tests can show the presence of the drug long after the person has sobered up. A blood test might be viable - but that's perhaps not practical, in terms of getting a cop to administer to a driver. With fatigue, it's even more problematic - there's no drug to detect at all. In light of this - has any general impairment test - that perhaps tests reaction times or some other metric, that can be administered at a roadside, been developed? "

I've done some reading on this and my vague idea so far is that circular structures perhaps allow the network to react to information based on its pattern, react to the information over time, so the C in an input series of A, B, C can be handled differently than the C in input series A, A, C.

        "We can read:The visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe of the brain and is primarily responsible for interpreting and processing visual information received from the eyes. The amount of visual information received and processed by the visual cortex is truly massive. Nearly half of the brain is in some way dedicated to vision—either direct communication pathways from the retina of the eyes to the occipital lobe, or to indirect visual processing and visual skills. The visual cortex is divided into six critical areas depending on the structure and function of the area. These are often referred to as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and the inferotemporal cortex. The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first stop for visual information in the occipital lobe.We can read:The primary auditory cortex is the first region of cerebral cortex to receive auditory input.Perception of sound is associated with the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). The superior temporal gyrus contains several important structures of the brain, including Brodmann areas 41 and 42, marking the location of the primary auditory cortex, the cortical region responsible for the sensation of basic characteristics of sound such as pitch and rhythm. We know from research in nonhuman primates that the primary auditory cortex can probably be divided further into functionally differentiable subregions.[36][37][38][39][40][41][42] The neurons of the primary auditory cortex can be considered to have receptive fields covering a range of auditory frequencies and have selective responses to harmonic pitches.[43] Neurons integrating information from the two ears have receptive fields covering a particular region of auditory space.The primary auditory cortex is surrounded by secondary auditory cortex, and interconnects with it. These secondary areas interconnect with further processing areas in the superior temporal gyrus, in the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and in the frontal lobe. In humans, connections of these regions with the middle temporal gyrus are probably important for speech perception. The frontotemporal system underlying auditory perception allows us to distinguish sounds as speech, music, or noise.On top of that it is known that the structure of the neurons in the cortex is the same where ever you look (though the division of the visual system is structure-based as can be read above). The information processing is just different in both (the neurons have different connection strengths).How do the two processes, though implemented on the same structure, differ from one another? Is the process of hearing more a serial parallel process due to the serial character of sound? How are the connection strengths between neurons involved? Wat makes sound different from vision?"

If the latter, that means that some psychedelic substances are able to agonise 5HT receptors without imitating serotonin, whereas the serotonergic psychedelics do this while imitating serotonin.If the former, then that means that not all psychedelics agonise the 5HT receptors, meaning that agonises the 5HT serotonin receptors, especially the 2A subtype, is not the definition of psychedelics.",

It has various levels of intensity, and we know that it can be helpful when the intensity does not exceed a threshold (and so could be appraised as potentially positive), it has an exciting valence, and makes you more focused.And yet (high) stress is unpleasant because it makes respiration difficult, gives a sensation of lump in throat, of bit of a knot in the stomach, makes the muscles tensed, the focused aspect can turn one to be less aware (of oneself's feelings and thoughts, of others, of features in the environment), etc.AngerWould say another example is anger. Anger has a positive dimension which is confidence, and yet at the same time a negative dimension which is unpleasantness.ExcitationAnother example is excitation, especially when it is disconnected to any event, but related to an enduring feeling of arousal (so more like a mood), because it gives you a sense of control and novelty, while at the same time can be painful because it makes feel restless and rash, both states which have usually a bad impact on interrelations, which then loop back negatively on well-being and self-confidence."

I mean this in a very specific way. It’s like they mistake someone asserting something for the discovery of a fact, from the oblivion. It’s almost like when propositions are placed somewhere free from context, the human mind through evolution has developed an (advantageous) tendency to absorb information / beliefs rapidly as they are transmitted. It would be way too much of an expense of cognitive energy to have to consider all logical factors necessary for a proposition to really be true. Even intelligent people must do it, it’s necessary for day to day functioning, and survival in / keeping up with a culture. You can imagine in paleolithic times, someone might say, There are blackberries in X location, and it's almost like a computer sending a transmission which automatically gets received. The sort of scrutiny mechanisms of human thought are not always active. There are times where just because someone said something, you immediately assume it's true without realizing or thinking about it, to the extent that you might transmit that information to someone else with the sense that it is authoritative knowledge. It's almost like we can intuitively distinguish between reported knowledge vs. (at least what we consider) an absolute fact, except we don't do it accurately - we are biased in favor of absolute facts over reported knowledge.In the extreme case it’s someone just believing anything they read online indiscriminately, but there are plenty of subtle everyday cases too.

It is covered on ESPN, and in the last few days I have heard both NPR and seen USA Today refer to it as such.  Full disclosure, I work for Gannett, the parent company of USA Today.What I would like to know is, Why?To be clear, I find the claim dubious, but if it is being referred to as a sport, there should be some rationality behind it. If not, then is it merely an idiom in the making?I understand what a game is - it is a test of skill in some fashion.  I understand what a sport is, at least in the abstract.  Football is a sport and has games.  Monopoly is a game, but rarely a sport.  Hiking is a sport, though, one rarely hears of hiking games.  So, while clearly there is an overlap between the two, there is also a set of attributes that differentiates the two.So, ultimately, what are those factors that adhere to the words Sport and Game, that are common to both and those that differentiate the two.

Gerunds were formed using to followed by a verbal noun in the dative case, which ended in -anne or -enne (e.g. tō cumenne = coming, to come).I read a bit on the use of infinitives in Old English; apparently, Old English has a to-infinitive that became Modern English infinitive.

Even  so commonly held, it seems a flawed assumption in view of the fact that  the extent to which most non-natives literally need to learn English  barely surpasses the routine, commonplace level of communication, and  thus, English cannot keep abreast of their mother languages, in that sense.My Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary loosely allows this ,at least as far as i see, saying:   abreast: ... 2. up to a particular standard or levelbefore narrowing it down:  especially of knowledge or recent developments.In hope of finding a similar statement as mine, I came across the following example, flipping through the web pages:   The Japanese video game industry has certainly failed to stay abreast  of its western rivals on the technological front. The Guardian Jul 17,  2013A native speaker said It sounds odd as English is not animated and cannot keep abreast of anything.

        "[The following is one of dozens of cases I come across on a daily basis]By accident, I have recently noticed that the phrasal verb go through (as in experience) -- which I've been using so far in my IELTS writing essays -- is associated with a connotation of negativeness (suffering, unpleasantness, etc). Flipping through dictionary pages I'm finding out they do not agree with one another over the level of negativity. Some have dismissed the negativity component very lightly, while others have fundamentally/thoroughly attached it to that concept. Others, though, have used parentheses. (Making a good decision in such case takes on added importance when I have, for instance, used go through in my essay, and after questioning its correctness I have ended up paging through dictionaries.)To clarify, here's where I'm finding myself locked in:  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary [11th]: go through: 2.EXPERIENCE; UNDERGO.    The American Heritage Dictionary (5th):2. go through: To experience; Undergo    The online ones:     Collins English Dictionary: 4.

Dict.s, in the case on hand) all the time, under the assumption that the others have left something out, because a lengthy definition isn't necessarily the best one. Using only one perfect dictionary? There is no such dictionary out there, or else the need to set up brilliant communities like this would have never made itself felt. Come here and ask? I guess this has to be the best answer, but the need is too frequent and it takes me a long time. Googling? Yes, that works in some cases.

        "Doubles for Alternate Sounds Per Letter -- Preface to Actual Subject:I am aware that, with the exception of the letters ess, thorn, eth (by extension, though not historically), b (older manuscripts*), and f (later manuscripts) [this list is all off the top of my head], if those appear in between vowels and voiced consonants, unless they be at the end of a syllable and then the start of another (e.g. bookkeeper, in E.M.E. and Contemp. Eng.), then they make a voiceless sound [save for b (older manuscripts)].*b was always /b/, but where f now makes the /v/ phoneme, b was used in some old manuscripts--such is to be expected.Actual Subject of the Question:I am aware that double consonants are supposed to be pronounced independently, except in the aforementioned case, but how is this done? Is this done the way we tend to do in spoken contemporary English, in sentences? E.g. Ship pan.There are two ways I can put across pronunciation of that: the way I hear most commonly here in America, and how I pronounce it, as something along the lines of shim-pan. Not quite an /m/, not really, but an unreleased, slightly held /p/.Or, as what I hear more commonly, it seems, though admit I don't hear it much, the received pronunciation, where one would hear along the lines of probably shiph-pan; Ph not standing for the aspirated consonant /pʰ/, but a normal /p/ with breath--the same breath would be replaced with a vowel, if one were to be.So, for example, the word scieppan. Without using I.P.A., the way I would write I currently say it is shim-pan, but m is not: /m/, as opposed to saying, again, as I would spell it: shi-phpan.In short, I cannot comprehend how two of the same plosive consonants can be next to each other without a vowel, or an extremely slight exhaling of air, like /h/, which, at least to me, should be written with an h or other equivalent letter.",

Is there a proper way? If I recall, in when using the international phonetic alphabet, you separate the letters with the angled-brackets (⟨⟩) from the sounds they make which are put in forward slashes (//.) That is fine, however, this is general English, not a pronunciation lesson.For example:Yesterday, Gary accidentally called a /G/ a /J/.I would, and always have, written this:Yesterday, Gary accidentally called a 'G' a 'j.'Writing just the letter as opposed to:Yesterday, Gary accidentally called a dgee (gee and jee, I suppose, are also acceptable) a jay.",

Obviously in English Bēon was the original infinitive which evolved into be, before the north received Earon from Latin, however the North readopted be for subjunctive. In my thinking, Be ye and Be thou would mean the same thing: subjunctive, e.g.:Be ye good and good should come/be thou good and good should come would both be the same as saying If thou beest good, good should come -- it may not, but it is an obligatory return vs. all saying: Be you good and good should come/Be thee good and good should come -- it may not, but it is not an obligatory return regardless of how you act.Obviously this is not the best example for subjunctive, but my question is clear -- one is imperative and one is saying if you choose to act a way then x will happen...",
        "I am curious as to how much believe on has been preferred in over believe in, and how much it has appeared in writing and manuscripts. I know the King James Bible uses it in only two books of its 66, but are there any other places where this queer verb phrase is used? I am thinking there may be a difference but may not. I noticed that in the context of the one work, it seems to be that when believe on is used, it is always used purely by someone saying something happened and people believing just because it is said, without seeing it. This would be rather useful in speech. I myself haven't thought much of it and actually do use these two distinctly and probably still will -- one for faith, one for having seen, but I am curious as to if this was common; why I bring it up is a person mentioned that the two mean the same and are not different. I am thinking it may be a dialectical thing or perhaps a conceptual -- it's not a literal translation of the Greek (which says into in every case,) so to me it must be a thing unique to Early Modern English.I am thinking that it may be just a left over quirk from before in and on switched usage frequency in english, from the Anglo Saxon roots.",

        "Occasionally I hear the word “no” used in a sentence where “not” seems more grammatical. I attribute this to idiom.For example I sometimes hear someone say, “That’s no fair,” or “That’s no good,” which seems grammatically parallel to the suggestion that I’m no tall. (Similarly we hear “Is this any good,” while nobody would ask whether my brother is any tall.)But on consideration there seem to be lots of parallel cases that sound right to me, for no reason that I can put my finger on. The following examples form a sort of spectrum until replacing “no” with “not” seems impossible.I’m no tall.That’s no fair.That’s no good.That’s no different.He’s no better than a common criminal.He’s no stronger than I am.Eating is no longer permitted in this library.This last example seems to cross the adjective-adverb membrane.

        "I have a smattering of exposure to several languages, and it appears to me that many languages allow a simpler* negation than we usually use in English. They allow the insertion of a word like no or not, without any additional verb.For example in Spanish we can negate the sentence Yo como (I eat) as Yo no como (I do not eat). No Spanish word corresponds to the word do, which we add in English.I do the dishes in the morning? Cool. I don't the dishes at night? Something's wrong.There are a few archaic exceptions.There's a sort of archaic negative imperative, as in Ask not whatyour country can do for you. Yoda approached it with his injunctionDo or do not.And in the archaic indicative, Ophelia mentioned toLaertes a certain proud and reckless libertine who recks not his ownreed.But most of us, living neither a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away nor in Elizabethan Denmark, would find other phrasings more natural. We seem to use negations pretty exclusively in multi-word verb forms. For example:In infinitives:  I like to not go, or I like not to go (with various degrees of clunkiness)With helping verbs: I am [not] swimming.But usually, we not just add not.So what ever happened to English? Is there an interesting story behind our inability to negate simply?NB: When I use the words simple and simpler, I'm not thinking about whether children growing up in various places find it easy or hard to learn the local language, or about whether adult native speakers find it easy or hard to communicate, or about whether adults learning a given language as a second language find that easy or hard to do. I'm not thinking about difficulty at all. I'm just referring to the addition of a single word as simpler than the addition of a group of words, for reasons that seem obvious to me but which I find I cannot explain at all. The simple negation of my title, and the simpler negation of my first sentence, is simply (that is, onewordishly) a one-word negation."

Then he looked for a phrase to say that each department was following their own agenda, and used the name of a famous Russian fable describing how a swan, a crab, and a pike tried to move a wagon, the swan trying to take to the skies, the pike going downstream, and the crab pulling it back.Here's the question: is there a phrase to describe a situation in which every party involved does their own thing, and their efforts are poorly coordinated?",

In sentence 1, [A] and [B] are both nouns (string beans and broccoli). In sentence 2 they are both prepositional phrases, and in sentence 3 they are both main clauses.Lily eats not only string beans but also broccoli.The candidates campaigned not only in Iowa but also in New Hampshire.Not only did Samuel start playing the piano before he could speak, but his mother taught him to compose music at a very early age.If you have a niggling doubt about the balance of your sentence when using this construction, ask yourself these five questions:Does each clause depend on each other to form a complete thought?Does each clause use the same part of speech and tense?Does my sentence make sense?Does my sentence sound natural?If I omit not only ... but also and insert and between the two elements, does my sentence still make sense?

It provides a straightforward and predictable way to form comparatives and superlatives without relying onirregular or unpredictable suffixes.Second answer:Longer adjectives often have complex or multisyllabic structures, making it more challenging to add suffixes like -er and -est without affecting the pronunciation or flow of the word. Using more and most allows for a smoother and more natural-sounding comparative form.Third answer:Using more and most for more-than-one-syllable adjectives maintains consistency with two-syllable adjectives that also use more and most for comparison. This avoids creating separate rules or patterns for different types of adjectivesIs there an identifiable reason for tending to restrict the forms -er, -est to single-syllable adjectives? It may be one of these I suppose; or something else.",

And while we may recognize objects or places (“that’s asubway” or “this is a fast food shop”), the style in which they areshown, treated by the camera, dislocates them from the plastic,sensate world.
